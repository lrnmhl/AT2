	\section{Spectra}
	\marginpar{\footnotesize{\textsc{Lecture 1} \\ 11.04.2022}}
		Let us start this course by motivating the theory of spectra and stable homotopy categories.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Representing objects for (co-)homology theories (Brown representability theorem).
		\item Freudenthal suspension theorem (Hatcher, \textbf{4.24}) \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Apparently, this wasn't proved in AlgTop1.}: Let $X$ be an $n$-connected CW complex. Then, the suspension homomorphism
		\[ \Sigma : \pi_k(X, *) \to \pi_{k+1}(\Sigma X, *), \ [f:S^k \to X]_* \mapsto [\Sigma f : S^{k+1} \cong \Sigma S^k \to \Sigma X]_* \]
		is an isomorphism for $1 \leq k \leq 2n$.
		\begin{example}
			Consider the sequence of isomorphisms
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\pi_1(S^1, *) \arrow[r, "\Sigma"] & \pi_2(S^2, *) \arrow[r, "\Sigma"] & \pi_3(S^3, *) \arrow[r] & \dots
					\\ \Z \arrow[u, equal] & \Z \arrow[u, equal] & \Z \arrow[u, equal]
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			We also have \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright The computation $\pi_4(S^3) \cong \Z/2$ is not that easy: \url{https://johncalab.github.io/stuff/sss.pdf}. See also \textbf{\#1.2}.}
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\pi_2(S^1, *) \arrow[r, "\Sigma"] & \pi_3(S^2, *) \arrow[r, "\Sigma"] & \pi_4(S^3, *) \arrow[r, "\sim"] & \dots
					\\ 0 \arrow[u, equal] & \Z \{\eta \} \arrow[u, equal] & (\Z/2) \{\eta \} \arrow[u, equal]
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			which becomes stable from $\pi_4(S^3, *)$ on.
			\medskip \\{\scriptsize Here's \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Note that this a priori only holds for CW complexes since Freudenthal only holds for CW complexes. But apparently Freudenthal's also holds in general.} a more detailed explanation of the stability behavior (Hatcher, p. 384): By Freudenthal's theorem suspension $\pi_k(X) \to \pi_{k+1}(\Sigma X)$ is an isomorphism for $k \leq 2n$. In particular, $\pi_{k+1}(\Sigma X) = 0$ for $k \leq n$ since $X$ is $n$-connected. Hence, $\Sigma X$ is $(n+1)$-connected (the suspension is always simply connected). Thus, $\pi_k(\Sigma X) \to \pi_{k+1}(\Sigma^2 X)$ is an isomorphism for $k \leq 2n+2$. This upper bound grows twice as quickly as the power of the suspension operator, so in the sequence
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						\pi_k(X) \arrow[r] & \pi_{k+1}(\Sigma X) \arrow[r] & \pi_{k+2}(\Sigma^2 X) \arrow[r] & \dots
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				eventually all maps will be isomorphisms. These will be the (stable) homotopy groups of the suspension spectra (\textbf{\ref{ex:first example of spectra}}). }
		\end{example}
		\item Universal home for stable phenomena: \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright A stable $\infty$-category is roughly an $\infty$-category such that there is an invertible suspension functor. Also some stuff on the presentability: \url{https://mathoverflow.net/questions/343132}.
			\\Schwede will give us some remarks about $\infty$-categorical shenanigans throughout the lecture course.} The $\infty$-category of spectra is the presentable stable $\infty$-category on one object (the sphere spectrum $\S$).
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Setup and first definitions}

	Let's give a first, rather quick \& dirty, definition.
	
	\begin{definition}
		A \textbf{\tb{(sequential) spectrum}} $X$ consists of 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item based spaces $X_n$ for $n \geq 0$
			\item continuous based maps $\sigma_n : \Sigma X_n \to X_{1+n}$.
		\end{itemize}
		A \textbf{\tb{morphism of spectra}} $f:X \to Y$ consists of a sequence $f_n : X_n \to Y_n$ of based continuous maps such that the following squares commute: 
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				\Sigma X_n \arrow[d, "\Sigma f_n", swap] \arrow[r, "\sigma_n^X"] & X_{1+n} \arrow[d, "f_{1+n}"]
				\\ \Sigma Y_n \arrow[r, "\sigma_n^Y", swap] & Y_{1+n}
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
	\end{definition}

	\noindent This forms the category of sequential \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Schwede wrote $\SpecCat^{\N}$ the first few times but later always wrote $\Sp$. So let me just always write $\Sp$.} spectra $\tb{\Sp^{\N}}$. Throughout this class a space will be a compactly generated space.
	
	\begin{definition}
		Let $X$ be a topological space. 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A subset $A \subseteq X$ is called \textbf{\tb{compactly closed}} if for every continuous map $f:K \to X$ from a compact\footnote{Here, we mean quasicompact and Hausdorff.} space $K$, the set $f^{-1}(A) \subseteq K$ is closed.
			\item $X$ is a \textbf{\tb{$k$-space (Kelley space)}} if any compactly closed subset is closed.
			\item $X$ is \textbf{\tb{weak Hausdorff}} if for continuous map $f:K \to X$ from a compact space $K$, the image $f(K) \subseteq X$ is closed.\marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Points are closed in weak Hausdorff spaces.}
			\item \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright The first definition in the literature writes just 'compactly generated' and not CGWH. Schwede doesn't understand why people made the first notion more complicated.} $X$ is \textbf{\tb{compactly generated}} if it is a $k$-space and weak Hausdorff.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{definition}
	\noindent Let $\Top$ denote the full subcategory of spaces consisting of compactly generated spaces.\footnote{Schwede denotes this by $\Tc$ but since we're also studying triangulated categories later, I'll use $\Top$. I need to make sure to edit out all the $\Tc$'s and put $\Top$ there.}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The category $\Top$ is cartesian closed, complete and cocomplete.
		\item Let's ad hoc'ly denote $\Top^{\operatorname{all}}$ by the category of all topological spaces. The inclusion  
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				\Top \arrow[r, hookrightarrow] & k\text{-spaces} \arrow[r, hookrightarrow] \arrow[l, "\text{weak Hausdorffication}", bend right, swap] & \Top^{\operatorname{all}} \arrow[l, bend left, "\text{Kelley functor}"]
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		\marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Weak Hausdorffication is left adjoint, Kelley functor is right adjoint.} The forgetful functor $\Top \to \Set$ does not preserve general colimits. 
		\item Every closed subset of a CW space is compactly generated.
		\item Every locally compact Hausdorff space, CW complex, metric space, manifold is compactly generated.
		\item Any disjoint union of CG spaces is CG.
		\item The ordinary product of CG spaces and a locally compact Hausdorff space is CG.
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{definition}
		The \textbf{\tb{$k$-th homotopy group}} for $k \in \Z$ of a spectrum $X$ is 
		\[ \tb{\pi_k(X)} = \colim_{n \in \Z: n+k \geq 0} \pi_{n+k}(X_n) \]
		where the colimit is taken over the sequence of maps \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright There is a reason to keep track that we suspend from the left, that's why we write $1+n$ instead of $n+1$.}
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				\pi_{n+k}(X_n) \arrow[r, "\Sigma"] & \pi_{1+n+k}(\Sigma X_n) \arrow[r, "{(\sigma_n)_*}"] & \pi_{1+n+k}(X_{1+n})
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
	\end{definition}
	\noindent Eventually, all maps in the colimit system are homomorphisms between abelian groups, so $\pi_k(X)$ 'is' an abelian group. Moreover, $\pi_k$ is functorial for morphisms of spectra, so we have defined functors
	\[ \pi_k : \Sp^{\N} \to \Ab \]
	for $k \in \Z$.
	\begin{definition}
		A morphism $f:X \to Y$ of spectra is a \textbf{\tb{stable equivalence}} if $\pi_k(f):\pi_k(X) \to \pi_k(Y)$ is an isomorphism of abelian groups for all $k \in \Z$. The \textbf{\tb{stable homotopy category}} is the $1$-categorical localization 
		\[ \tb{\SH} = \Sp^{\N}[(\text{stable equivalences})^{-1}]. \]
		The \textbf{\tb{$\infty$-categorical spectra}} are given by the $\infty$-categorical localization
		\[ \tb{\Sp_{\infty}} = \Sp^{\N}[(\text{stable equivalences})^{-1}]_{\infty}. \]
	\end{definition}
	\noindent Schwede about these $\infty$-categorical inserts: \emph{It would feel weird if I didn't tell you because that's what the modern kids play with.}
	
	\subsection{Examples}
	We give a number of rather interesting examples that we'll endow with even more structure later on.
		
	\begin{example} \label{ex:first example of spectra}
		Later with more structure.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item Suspension spectra: Let $K$ be a based space. The \textbf{\tb{suspension spectrum}} $\tb{\Sigma^{\infty} K}$ is the spectrum $(\Sigma^{\infty} K)_n = S^n \wedge K$ with the structure maps \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright We use CG spaces to get associativity.} 
			\[ \sigma_n : \Sigma (\Sigma^{\infty} K)_n = S^1 \wedge (S^n \wedge K) \cong (S^1 \wedge S^n) \wedge K \cong S^{1+n} \wedge K = (\Sigma^{\infty}K)_{n+1}. \] \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright The homeomorphism with the sphere isn't all that canonical. This convention is better for spectra because it is compatible with smash products. Get e.g. $S^m \wedge S^n \cong S^{m+n}$ nicely.} Here, $\tb{S^n} = \R^n \cup \{\infty \}$ with the one-point compactification topology.\footnote{Recall $\tb{X \wedge Y} = (X \times Y)/((X \times y_0) \cup (x_0 \times Y))$ for based spaces. Note that this should a priori use the (co-)limits in CG spaces. Also recall that
				\begin{align*} \Sigma X &= (X \times [0,1])/((X \times \{0,1 \}) \cup (\{x_0 \} \times [0,1])) 
					\\ &\cong (X \times S^1)/((X \times \{z_0 \}) \cup (\{x_0 \} \times S^1) = X \wedge S^1.
			\end{align*}} Then,
			\[ \pi_k(\Sigma^{\infty}K) = \colim_{n} \pi_{n+k}(S^n \wedge K) \]
			which is the \textbf{\tb{$k$-th stable homotopy group of $K$}}. If the basepoint is \textbf{\tb{non-degenerate}} (i.e. the pointed space with that basepoint is well-pointed), then $S^n \wedge K$ is $(n-1)$-connected. So $\pi_k(\Sigma^{\infty} K) = 0$ for $k < 0$. Moreover,
			\[ \pi_0(\Sigma^{\infty}K) \cong \tilde{H}_0(K;\Z) = \Z[\pi_0(K)]. \]
			{\scriptsize If $K$ is well-pointed, then $I \times * \to SK$ is a cofibration\footnote{See \url{https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~tcutler/pdf/Week\%202\%20-\%20Cofibrations.pdf}, p. 8.} and since $I \times *$ is contractible, we deduce that $SX \to SX/(I \times *) \cong \Sigma K$ is a homotopy equivalence (Hatcher, \textbf{0.17}). Therefore, $S^n \wedge K \simeq S^n K$ and now we can apply Freudenthal $n$-times to shift connectedness.
			\medskip \\In this case, we deduce
			\[ \pi_0(\Sigma^{\infty}K) = \colim_n \pi_n(\Sigma^n K) \cong \pi_2(\Sigma^2 K) \cong \tilde{H}_2(\Sigma^2 K;\Z) \cong \tilde{H}_0(K;\Z). \] with $S^n K \simeq \Sigma^n K$, Freudenthal suspension, Hurewicz and the fact that suspension shifts homology (see Hatcher, \textbf{\#2.2.32}). Thanks to Felix for some pointers!}
			\item Sphere spectra: The \textbf{\tb{sphere spectrum}} is
			\[ \tb{\S} = (S^n, \sigma_n:S^1 \wedge S^n \xrightarrow{\sim} S^{1+n}) \cong \Sigma^{\infty} S^0. \]
			Then, $\pi_k(\S) = \colim_n \pi_{n+k}(S^n)$ is called the \textbf{\tb{$k$-th stable homotopy group of spheres, on the $k$-th stable stem}}. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright In some sense, this is canonical.}  Have $\pi_k(\S) = 0$ for $k < 0$ and $\pi_0(\S) \cong \Z$. 
			\begin{theorem}[Serre]
				For $k,n \geq 1$, the group $\pi_k(S^n, *)$ is finite, unless $k = n$ or ($n$ even and $k = 2n-1$). \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright I think this was in Hatcher's SSAT?}
			\end{theorem}
			For the edge cases: We know e.g. $\pi_3(S^2) \cong \Z \{\eta \}$ and $\pi_7(S^4) \cong \Z \{\nu \} \oplus ?$. \medskip \\Anyhow, along with the Freudenthal suspension theorem, we obtain that $\pi_k(\S)$ is finite for $k > 0$. The stable stems in small dimensions: \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright For $n = 1$ one says that the stable class is born on the $2$-sphere.
			\\This $\eps$ at the end is allegedly harder to explain.
			\\Schwede likes ending at $k = 8$ because this is the first instance where $\pi_k(\S)$ is not cyclic.}
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tabular}{l*{8}{c}r}
					$k$             & $0$ & $1$ & $2$ & $3$ & $4$  & $5$ & $6$ & $7$ & $8$ \\
					\hline
					$\pi_k(\S)$            & $\Z$ & $\Z/2$ & $\Z/2$ & $\Z/24$ &  $0$ & $0$  & $\Z/2$ & $\Z/240$ & $(\Z/2)^2$ \\
					Generators          & $\id_{S^1}$ & $\eta$ & $\eta^2$ & $\nu$ &  &  & $\nu^2$ & $\sigma$ & $\eta \sigma, \eps$  \\
				\end{tabular}
			\end{center} To understand $\eta^2$, there will be a graded ring structure. Recall: The \textbf{\tb{first, second and third Hopf maps}} are
			\begin{itemize}
				\item $\tb{\eta} : S(\CC^2) \cong S^3 \to \CC P^1 \cong S^2, \ (x,y) \mapsto \CC \cdot (x,y)$,
				\item $\tb{\nu} : S(\HH^2) \cong S^7 \to \HH P^1 \cong S^4, \ (x,y) \mapsto \HH \cdot (x,y)$,
				\item \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright One has to be careful with projective spaces for $\mathbb O$.} $\tb{\sigma} : S(\mathbb{O}^2) \cong S^{15} \to \mathbb{O} \cup \{\infty \} \cong S^8, \ (x,y) \mapsto \frac{x}{y}$.
			\end{itemize}
			This table contains basically all multiplicative relations besides $\eta^3 = 12 \nu$.
			\item \marginpar{\footnotesize{\textsc{Lecture 2} \\ 13.04.2022}} Eilenberg-MacLane spectra: Let $A$ be an abelian group. Choose an EM-space $(K(A,n), \phi_n)$ of type $(A,n)$ for all $n \geq 0$ where $\phi_n:\pi_n(K(A,n)) \to A$ is a chosen isomorphism. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Note that $\Omega K(A,n+1)$ is not a CW complex anymore.} Then, $\Omega K(A,n+1)$\footnote{Recall the convention $\tb{\Omega Y} = \map_*(S^1, Y)$.} is an EM-space of type $(A,n)$, so there is a based continuous map $\tilde{\sigma}_n : K(A,n) \to \Omega K(A,n+1)$, unique up to homotopy, such that the following triangle of abelian groups commutes (\textbf{Hatcher, \#4.2.17}):
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\pi_n(K(A,n), *) \arrow[dr, "\phi_n", swap] \arrow[rr, "{(\tilde{\sigma}_n)_*}"] & & \pi_n(\Omega K(A,n+1), *) \arrow[r, "\sim"] & \pi_{n+1}(K(A,n+1),*) \arrow[dll, "\phi_{n+1}"]
					\\ & A
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			Moreover, $\tilde{\sigma}_n$ is a weak homotopy equivalence. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{What does $H$ stand for? \\Actually, what does even $K$ stand for? \\Should this be \texttt{\textbackslash operatorname}'d?}} The \textbf{\tb{Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum $HA$}} is given by
			\[ (HA)_n = K(A,n), \ \sigma_n : S^1 \wedge K(A,n) \to K(A,n+1) \]
			where $\sigma_n$ is the adjoint of $\tilde{\sigma}_n$ via the $(\Sigma, \Omega)$-adjunction.
			\begin{exercise}[Hopefully later]
				Any two sets of choices give stably equivalent spectra.
			\end{exercise}
			Moreover, 
			\[ \pi_k(HA) = \colim_n \pi_{n+k}(K(A,n)) \cong \begin{cases}
				0 \quad & k \neq 0,
				\\ A & k = 0
			\end{cases} \]
			where we use that we made sure that $\sigma_n$ is compatible with the identifications to $A$, so it yields a preferred isomorphism above. (Note that $(\tilde{\sigma}_n)_*$ is an isomorphism by all other maps in that diagram are isomorphisms.)
			\begin{fact}[Later]
				The map
				\[ \pi_0 : \SH(HA, HB) \to \Hom_{\Ab}(A,B) \]
				is a bijection.
			\end{fact}
			We use the universal property of localization here.
			\item Bordism spectra/Thom spectra: Let $\tb{\Gr_n}$ be the Grassmannian of $n$-planes in $\R^{\infty}$, i.e. $\Gr_n = \bigcup_{k \geq 0} \Gr_n(\R^k)$ with the weak topology. Recall that over $\Gr_n$ sits a 'universal' $n$-plane bundle with total space
			\[ \tb{E_n} = \{(x, L) \in \R^{\infty} \times \Gr_n : x \in L \} \]
			with a map $\gamma_n : E_n \to \Gr_n, \ (x,L) \mapsto L$.
			\begin{fact}[Universality] \label{fact:universality}
				For every paracompact space $X$, the map
				\[ [X, \Gr_n] \to \Vect_n(X), \ [f] \mapsto [f^*\gamma_n] \]
				is a bijection. Here, $\tb{\Vect_n(X)}$ is the class of rank $n$ vector bundles over $X$.
			\end{fact}
			The \textbf{\tb{Thom space}} of $\gamma_n$ is $\tb{\MO_n} = D(\gamma_n)/S(\gamma_n)$ where 
			\[ \tb{D(\gamma_n)} = \{(x,L) : |x| \leq 1 \}, \ \tb{S(\gamma_n)} = \{(x,L):|x| = 1 \} \]
			are the \textbf{\tb{disc bundle}} and the \textbf{\tb{sphere bundle}}. \marginpar{\tiny Choice made here.} The $(n+1)$-plane bundle $\ul{\R} \oplus \gamma_n$ is classified via universality (\textbf{\ref{fact:universality}}) by a map $c: \Gr_n \to \Gr_{n+1}$, unique up to homotopy, such that $c^* \gamma_{n+1} \cong \ul{\R} \oplus \gamma_n$. The isomorphism amounts to a commutative square
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\ul{\R} \oplus E_n \arrow[d, "\ul{\R} \oplus \gamma_n", swap] \arrow[r, "\ol{c}"] & E_{n+1} \arrow[d, "\gamma_{n+1}"]
					\\ \Gr_n \arrow[r, "c", swap] & \Gr_{n+1}.
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			This data induces a map of Thom spaces. Check that \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{Maybe rather do a proper bibliography.}} (\textbf{Algebraic Topology from a Homotopical Viewpoint, 11.7.4}):
			\[ S^1 \wedge \MO_n = S^1 \wedge (D(\gamma_n)/S(\gamma_n)) \cong D(\ul{\R} \oplus \gamma_n)/S(\ul{\R} \oplus \gamma_n) \xrightarrow{\Sigma} D(\gamma_{n+1})/S(\gamma_{n+1}) = \MO_{1+n} \]
			is well-defined where $\Sigma = D(\ol{c})/S(\ol{c})$. This is the structure map of the \textbf{\tb{Thom spectrum/bordism spectrum}} $\tb{\MO}$.
			{\scriptsize \medskip \\Here, $\Sigma$ is well-defined: In general for a vector bundle $E \to B$ with a Riemannian metric, another map $g:B' \to B$ induces a map $\Th(g^*E) \to \Th(E)$ by the manner the pullback of Riemannian metrics on vector bundles are constructed. At least I expect this pullback to be $\langle x,y \rangle_{g^*E} = \langle \ol{g}(x), \ol{g}(y) \rangle$ where $\ol{g}$ is the base change map of $g$. Though $g$ should somehow still be nice enough to ensure positive definiteness. (Is there any reference on this?)
				\medskip \\More explicitly, this map is given by $S^1 \wedge \MO_n \to \MO_{1+n}, \ x \wedge [v,L] \mapsto [(x,v), \R \oplus L]$.
			}
			\begin{theorem}[Thom]
				The \textbf{\tb{Thom-Pontryagin construction}} induces an isomorphism of graded rings
				\[ \tb{\Omega_*} \xrightarrow{\ \sim \ } \pi_*(\MO) \]
				where $(\tb{\Omega_*}, \sqcup, \times)$ is the ring of bordism classes of smooth closed manifolds and $(\tb{\Omega_k}, \sqcup)$ is the abelian group of bordism classes of smooth closed $k$-manifolds.
			\end{theorem}
			\item Topological $K$-Theory: Let $\tb{U} = \colim_{n \geq 0} U(n)$ be the \tb{\textbf{infinite unitary group}} along 
			\[ U(n) \to U(n+1), \ A \mapsto \m{A & 0 \\ 0 & 1}. \]
			\begin{theorem}[Bott periodicity]
				There is a homotopy equivalence $\Omega^2 U \xleftarrow{\simeq} U$.
			\end{theorem}
			The \textbf{\tb{spectrum of topological $K$-theory $\KU$}} is defined by
			\[ \tb{\KU_n} = \begin{cases}
				U \quad & n \text{ odd},
				\\ \Omega U & n \text{ even}
			\end{cases} \]
			with structure maps
			\begin{itemize}
				\item For $n$ even: $\Sigma \Omega U \to U$ adjoint to $\id_{\Omega U}$,
				\item For $n$ odd: $\Sigma U \to \Omega U$ adjoint to the equivalence $U \xrightarrow{\ \simeq \ } \Omega^2 U$.
			\end{itemize}
			Here, $U(n)$ is path-connected \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Diagonalize and take a path on diagonal matrices: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_group\#Topology}.} and $\pi_1(U(n),*) \cong \Z$ using an inductive argument to show $\pi_1(U(n), *) \xrightarrow{\ \sim \ } \pi_1(U(1), *) \cong \Z$ since $U(1) \cong S^1$. 
			\medskip \\More precisely, the inclusions $U(n) \to U(n+1)$ induce isomorphisms on $\pi_0$ and $\pi_1$ for all $n \geq 1$ via the fiber bundle $U(n) \to U(n+1) \to S^{2n+1}$ (\textbf{Hatcher, 4.55}). In particular, $\pi_0(U) \cong 0$ and $\pi_1(U) \cong \Z$ showing \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright We are using that nice colimits commute with homotopy groups (\textbf{\ref{prop: colimit preservations}}).}
			\[ \pi_k(\KU) \cong \begin{cases}
				\Z \quad & k \text{ even},
				\\ 0 & k \text{ odd}
			\end{cases} \]
			through Bott periodicity. 
			\medskip \\The relation to vector bundles is via clutching functions.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{example}

	{\scriptsize \noindent Here is an example of a spectrum with negative homotopy groups. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Why have we never discussed such negative shifts?} Let $X$ be a spectrum, then $\pi_{-1}(X) = \colim_{n} \pi_{n-1}(X_n)$. We pick $X_0 = *$ and $X_n = K(A,n-1)$ with any map $\Sigma * \to X_1$, then $\pi_{-1}(X) = A$. So we're doing something like a negative shift to $HA$.

	\section{Orthogonal spectra}
	Sequential spectral are fine for many purposes such as
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the stable homotopy category as a triangulated category
		\item the $\infty$-category of spectra
	\end{itemize}
	But sequential spectra are not ideal for 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item multiplicative properties (ring spectra, smash product)
		\item equivariant generalizations \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Schwede did quite some research on this and there will be a class on this equivariant stuff next semester.}
	\end{itemize}
	Schwede's personal experience is that orthogonal spectra have the least annoyances among the many models of spectra.
	
	\subsection{Two definitions}
	Let's start with a definition that is closer to our definition of sequential spectra.
	
	\begin{definition}[Coordinatized orthogonal spectra]
		A \textbf{\tb{(coordinatized) orthogonal spectrum}} consist of
		\begin{itemize}
			\item a based space $X_n$ for $n \geq 0$
			\item a continuous and based action of $O(n)$ on $X_n$ for all $n \geq 0$ \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Note that $X_n \times O(n)$ in the action is given by the product in CG spaces. But $O(n)$ is (locally) compact, so this will have the usual topology anyway.}

			\medskip \\There is an easier and more explicit way to do this (thanks Christian!) \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{What would be a natural way to guess this?}}: This $O(m)$-action on $S^m$ is really the action of $O(m) \injArrow O(m+1)$ on $S^m$, where the embedding is $A \mapsto \m{A & 0 \\ 0 & 1}$. Indeed, e.g. stereographic projection yields the coordinate transformation \[ (x,y,z) = \left( \frac{2X}{1+X^2+Y^2}, \frac{2Y}{1+X^2+Y^2}, \frac{-1+X^2+Y^2}{1+X^2+Y^2} \right) \in S^2 \]
			with $(X,Y) \in \R^2$. Orthogonal matrices are length-preserving, so they preserve all these $X^2+Y^2$ terms and hence what remains of $A$ is indeed the linear $A$-action on the first two coordinates.\medskip \\} The action on $X_{m+n}$ is obtained from the block sum embedding
			\[ O(m) \times O(n) \to O(m+n), \ (A, B) \mapsto \m{A & 0 \\ 0 & B}. \]

		A \textbf{\tb{morphism of orthogonal spectra}} $f:X \to Y$ consists of $O(n)$-equivariant based continuous maps $f_n : X_n \to Y_n$ such that the square

	\noindent So we obtain the category of orthogonal spectra $\tb{\Sp}$. 
	\medskip \\Note that every orthogonal spectrum has an underlying sequential spectrum by forgetting the $O(n)$-actions. So there is a forgetful functor $U : \Sp \to \Sp^{\N}$.
	\medskip \\Homotopy groups and stable equivalences of orthogonal spectra are defined in $\Sp^{\N}$. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright One can shows that this agrees with the previous definition via the forgetful functor. The usual way is via right Quillen functors with a suitable model category structure.} The stable homotopy category could equivalently be defined as $\SH = \Sp[(\text{stable equivalences})^{-1}]$.
	
	\begin{example}
		The \textbf{\tb{suspension spectrum $\Sigma^{\infty} K$}} of a based space $K$ is $(\Sigma^{\infty}K)_n = S^n \wedge K$ with the tautological $O(n)$-action on $S^n$ \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright 'Canonical' is a meta-term.} and the expected structure maps $\sigma_n : S^1 \wedge S^n \wedge K \to S^{1+n} \wedge K$. Equivariance boils down to (since $\infty$ always gets mapped to $\infty$)
		\[ \R^m \times \R^n \to \R^{m+n}, \ ((x_1, \dots, x_m), (y_1, \dots, y_n)) \mapsto (x_1, \dots, x_m, y_1, \dots, y_n) \]
		being $(O(m) \times O(n))$-equivariant which is true by construction.
	\end{example}

	\noindent We'll now be dealing with orthogonal Eilenberg-MacLane spaces. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright We need to be more careful now. Before, we were basically able to make random choices.}
	\medskip \\Let $K$ be a based space and let $\tb{A[K]} = A\{K \}/A\{* \}$ denote the reduced $A$-linearization of $K$. We endow $A[K]$ with the quotient topology of the surjective map 
	\[ \coprod_{n \geq 0} (A^n \times K^n) \to A[K], \ (a_1, \dots, a_n, k_1, \dots, k_n) \mapsto a_1 k_1 + \dots + a_n k_n \]
	where $A^n$ is given the discrete topology.

	\end{theorem}
	\noindent This \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright I think he rather means that this is a functor of enriched categories (and not that it is limit-preserving).

So the $O(n)$-action on $S^n$ induces a continuous $O(n)$-action on $A[S^n]$. The \textbf{\tb{orthogonal spectrum $HA$}} is defined by $(HA)_n = A[S^n]$ with the structure maps
	\[ S^1 \wedge HA_n = S^1 \wedge A[S^n] \to A[S^{1+n}] = HA_{1+n}, \ x \wedge \sum_i a_i y_i \mapsto \sum_i a_i (x \wedge y_i). \]
	One checks that this is continuous and equivariant. \marginpar{\tiny \tr{Check!}}

	\medskip \\Let us now try to define a coordinate-free version by replacing anything with $n$ by an inner product space $V$.
	\begin{definition}
		An \textbf{\tb{inner product space}} is a finite-dimensional Euclidean vector space. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright This is mostly motivation here.}
	\end{definition}
	\noindent The idea is to make the replacements
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $X_n \rightsquigarrow X(V)$ for an inner product space $V$,
		\item $O(n) \acts X_n \rightsquigarrow O(V) \acts X(V)$.
		\item $\sigma^m : S^m \wedge X_n \to X_{m+n} \rightsquigarrow S^V \wedge X(W) \to X(V \oplus W)$ where $\tb{S^V} = V \cup \{\infty \}$ with the one-point compactification topology.
		\medskip \\More generally, we want structure maps for all linear isometric embeddings $\phi : V \injArrow W$ given as
		\[ \phi_*: S^{W-\phi(V)} \wedge X(V) \to X(W). \]
		We write $\tb{U \leq W}$ for subspaces and $\tb{W-U} = U^{\perp} = \{w \in W: \langle w,u \rangle = 0 \quad \text{or all } u \in U \}$.
	\end{itemize}
	Schwede: \emph{Mathematicians come in two flavours: Those who like really concrete stuff and those who like really abstract stuff.}
	
	\begin{construction}
		For inner product spaces $V,W$ let $\tb{L(V,W)}$ denote the space of linear isometric embeddings. If $(v_1, \dots, v_n)$ is an orthonormal basis of $V$, then the evaluation
		\[ L(V,W) \to V_n(W) \subseteq W^n, \ (\phi : V \to W) \mapsto (\phi(v_1), \dots, \phi(v_n)) \]
		is a bijection. We topologize $L(V,W)$ by making this map a homeomorphism. Check: The topology doesn't depend on the choice of $(v_1, \dots, v_n)$.
		\medskip \\For this topology, the composition
		\[ L(V,W) \times L(U,V) \to L(U,W), \ (\phi, \psi) \mapsto \phi \circ \psi \]
		is continuous. So we get a category enriched over $\Top$.
		\medskip \\ The \textbf{\tb{orthogonal complement bundle}} \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright This is ad hoc terminology.} $\tb{\xi(V,W)}$ over $L(V,W)$ is
		\[ \xi(V,W) = \{(w,\phi) \in W \times L(V,W) : w \perp \phi(V) \} \to L(V,W), \ (w, \phi) \mapsto \phi. \]
		Check: This is an Euclidean vector bundle of rank $\dim{W} - \dim{V}$. (Recall the construction of $L(V,W)$ and trivialize with that trivialization.)
		\medskip \\We define
		\[ \tb{\Oc(V,W)} = \operatorname{Th}(\xi(V,W)) = \xi(V,W) \cup \{\infty \} \]
		with the one-point compactification topology. Note that our base space $L(V,W)$ is compact which is why the Thom space coincides with the one-point compactification.
		\medskip \\The maps 
		\[ \xi(V,W) \times \xi(U,V) \to \xi(U,W), \ ((w, \phi), (v, \psi)) \mapsto (w+\phi(v), \phi \circ \psi) \]
		cover the maps of the composition of linear isometric embeddings. Check: This is continuous. Schwede: \emph{But what should go wrong, everything is natural and so on, mumble mumble...}
		\medskip \\This extends continuously (check!) to based maps
		\[ \Oc(V,W) \wedge \Oc(U,V) \to \Oc(U, W). \]
		This defines a \textbf{\tb{based topological category\footnote{I.e. a category enriched over $\Top_*$.} $\Oc$}}, the category of inner product spaces. The identity of $V$ is $\id_V = (0, \id_V) \in \Oc(V,V)$.
	\end{construction}

	\noindent Note that
	\[ \Oc(V,V) = \xi(V, V) \cup \{\infty \} = \{(0,A) : A \in O(V) \} \cup \{\infty \} = \tb{O(V)_+} \]
	which uses that $O(V)$ is already compact.
	
	\begin{remark} \marginpar{\tiny This was in lecture 4.} \label{remark: explicit descriptions of L, xi, O}
		If $\dim{V} = m$ and $\dim{W} = n$, then
		\[ L(V,W) \cong V_m(\R^n) \cong O(n)/O(n-m). \]
		Moreover, we obtain
		\[ \xi(V,W) \cong V_m(\R^n) \times_{O(n-m)} \R^{n-m} \]
		and
		\[ \Oc(V,W) \cong V_m(\R^n)_+ \wedge_{O(n-m)} S^{n-m} = O(n)_+ \wedge_{O(n-m)} S^{n-m}. \]

	\noindent Explicitly:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For all inner product spaces $V$ we get a based space $X(V)$.
		\item We have based continuous maps 
		\[ \Oc(V,W) \wedge X(V) \to X(W) \]
		for all $V,W \in \Oc$. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright By adjunction, this corresponds to a map $\Oc(V,W) \to \map_*(X(V), X(W))$.}

	Then, $O(V)$ acts on $X(V)$ by the composition

	\noindent We will often specify a functor $X: \Oc \to \Top_*$ by specifying $X(V)$ with these $O(V)$-actions along with $\sigma_{VW} : S^V \wedge X(W) \to X(V \oplus W)$ and leave the rest implicit.
	
	\subsection{Examples}
	We will basically refine our examples of sequential spectra to orthogonal spectra.

			\item $\sigma_{VW}(v \wedge w \wedge k) = ((v,0) + (0,w)) \wedge k = (v,w) \wedge k$.
		\end{itemize}
		These indeed agree with the coordinatized versions of $\Sigma^{\infty}K$.}

	\begin{example}[$\MO$ as an orthogonal spectrum] \label{example: Thom spectrum as orthogonal spectrum}
		For an inner product space $V$ let $\tb{\Gr_{|V|}(V^{\infty})}$ be the Grassmannian of $\dim(V)$-planes of $\tb{V^{\infty}} = \bigoplus_{n \geq 0} V$ with the weak topology of $\Gr_{|V|}(V^m)$. For $V \neq 0$ we have $V^{\infty} \cong \R^{\infty}$ (non-canonically). The space $\Gr_{|V|}(V^{\infty})$ comes with a continuous $O(V)$-action from the coordinatized action on $V^{\infty}$, i.e. by $A(v_0, v_1, \dots) = (Av_0, Av_1, \dots)$. Let 
		\[ \gamma_V : L(V, V^{\infty}) \to \Gr_{|V|}(V^{\infty}), \ \phi \mapsto \phi(V) \]
		denote the tautological principal \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright The fibers are $O(V)$.} $O(V)$-bundle where we give the weak topology to $L(V, V^{\infty})$ again. (Check: This $\gamma_V$ is continuous.)
		\medskip \\We get $L(V, V^{\infty}) \times_{O(V)} V \to \Gr_{|V|}(V^{\infty})$ which is the tautological vector bundle. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright This seems to be a general construction: \url{https://mathoverflow.net/questions/5772}. \medskip \\I guess a very rough intuition: The fibers were $O(V)$. Taking $-\times V$ gives fibers $O(V) \times V$. Modding out $O(V)$ finally leaves fibers $V$.} 
		{\scriptsize \medskip \\Call the bundle $p$ and let $W \in \Gr_{|V|}(V^{\infty})$. We fix a linear isometry $i:V \xrightarrow{\ \sim \ } W \subseteq V^{\infty}$ and take the maps

				\\ w &\mapsto (i,i^{-1}(w)),
				\\ \phi(v) &\mapsfrom (\phi, v).
			\end{align*}
		The map $p^{-1}(\{W \}) \to W$ is well-defined using $\phi(V) = W$. The composition $W \to p^{-1}(\{W \}) \to W$ is certainly the identity. On the other hand, $p^{-1}(\{W \}) \to W \to p^{-1}(\{W \})$ is also the identity since $(i,i^{-1}(\phi(v))) \sim (\phi, v)$ because $i^{-1} \circ \phi \in O(V)$. Thus, we have convinced ourselves that a fiber of $W$ is indeed $W$ itself. I supposed it'll require a little more work to prove that we actually obtain a vector bundle but this should suffice for now.

	\section{Constructions in the category of spectra}
	We discuss limits, colimits, certain functors (most notably $\Sigma, \Omega, \sh, \lambda$) and long exact sequences.
	
	\subsection{Limits and colimits in the category of spectra}
	The category of orthogonal spectra has limits and colimits \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright So we are probably taking the underlying ordinary category and apply the usual result that (co-)limits can be computed objectwise.} and they are all constructed objectwise in $\Top_*$.
	\medskip \\Let $J$ be a small category and $F:J \to \Sp$ be a functor. We define $\colim_J {F} \in \Sp$ by 
	\[ \left(\colim_J F \right)(V) = \colim_{j \in J} {(F(j)(V))} = \colim_{J} {(\ev_V \circ F)} \]
	where $\ev_V : \Sp \to \Top_*, \ X \mapsto X(V)$. This inherits structure maps as follows:
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			S^V \wedge \left(\colim_{j \in J} F(j)(W) \right) \arrow[r, dashed, "\sigma_{VW}^J"] & \colim_{j \in J} F(j)(V \oplus W)
			\\ \colim_{j \in J} (S^V \wedge F(j)(W)) \arrow[u, "\wr"] \arrow[ur, "\colim_{j \in J} \sigma_{VW}^{F(j)}", swap]
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	where the isomorphism on the left is because $S^V \wedge -$ as a left adjoint commutes with colimits. Our entire discussion is really an abstract property of enriched functor categories.
	\medskip \\A limit of $F : J \to \Sp$ can be constructed by
	\[ \left(\lim_J F \right)(V) = \lim_{j \in J} {(F(j)(V))} = \lim_J {( \ev_V \circ F)} \]
	with structure maps $S^V \wedge \lim_J F(W) \to \lim_J F(V \oplus W)$ adjoint to 
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\lim_{j \in J} F(j)(W) \arrow[r, dashed] \arrow[dr, "\lim_{j \in J} \tilde{\sigma}_{VW}^{F(j)}", swap] & \map_* \left(S^V, \lim_{j \in J} F(j)(V \oplus W) \right) \arrow[d, "\wr"]
			\\ & \lim_{j \in J} \map_*(S^V, F(j)(V \oplus W))
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	where for an orthogonal spectrum $X$ the map $\tb{\tilde{\sigma}_{VW}} : X(W) \to \map_*(S^V, X(V \oplus W))$ is the adjoint of the structure map $\sigma_{VW} : S^V \wedge X(W) \to X(V \oplus W)$.
	\subsection{Functorial constructions, suspension, loop}
	The \marginpar{\footnotesize{\textsc{Lecture 4} \\ 25.04.2022}} \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Schwede gave some explicit descriptions $L, \xi, \Oc$ at the beginning of this lecture which I added in \textbf{\ref{remark: explicit descriptions of L, xi, O}}.} heart of a spectrum is the $(\Sigma, \Omega)$-adjunction. But not only are they central in the definition of spectra, they also interact nicely with spectra.
	
	\begin{example}
		Let $F:\Top_* \to \Top_*$ be a $\Top_*$-enriched functor. For every orthogonal spectrum $X: \Oc \to \Top_*$, the composite
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				\Oc \arrow[r, "X"] & \Top_* \arrow[r, "F"] & \Top_* 
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		is an orthogonal spectrum.
		\medskip \\Similarly on morphisms (i.e. the natural transformations). So altogether we obtain a functor $\tb{F \circ -} : \Sp \to \Sp$.
	\end{example}

	\begin{example}
		Smashing with adjoint maps from a based space $A$. There is an adjoint functor pair

		These functors \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright This is Riehl, \textbf{4.4.6}. (Schwede really means that there is an adjunction on the underlying categories of these enriched categories.)} along with the unit and counit of the adjunction extend to an adjoint functor pair

		More concretely, this means -- after unravelling the definitions -- that for an orthogonal spectrum $X$ we get
		\[ (X \wedge A)(V) = X(V) \wedge A \]
		with structure maps
		\[ S^V \wedge (X \wedge A)(W) = S^V \wedge X(W) \wedge A \xrightarrow{\sigma_{VW}^X \wedge A} X(V \oplus W) \wedge A = (X \wedge A)(V \oplus W). \]
		Moreover, $\map_*(A,X) = X^A$ has values
		\[ \map_*(A,X)(V) = \map_*(A,X(V)) \]
		with structure maps
		\[ S^V \wedge \map_*(A, X(W)) \xrightarrow{v \wedge f \mapsto (a \mapsto v \wedge f(a))} \map_*(A, S^V \wedge X(W)) \xrightarrow{\map_*(A, \sigma_{VW}^X)} \map_*(A, X(V \oplus W)) \]
		where \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{So what's actually going on underneath the hood here?}} the first map is something like the map on Hom's induced by $\lim$ only that this is not really a limit.
	\end{example}
	\noindent Now, \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright For spaces these are somewhat controllable: Suspension is good with (co-)homology and loop space is good with homotopy groups. But this is about all that one can say in the unstable case.} we will study the special case $A = S^1$ in more detail:
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Sp \arrow[rr, "- \wedge S^1", shift left] &  &\Sp \arrow[ll, "{\tb{\Omega} = \map_*(S^1,-)}", shift left]
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	The  upper map is called \textbf{\tb{suspension}} and the lower map is called \textbf{\tb{loop}}.
	\medskip \\Stably (i.e. for spectra), loop and suspension are 'inverse up to homotopy'. This part of the story works for sequential spectra. (It will be a priori more general via the forgetful functor from $\Sp$ and since homotopy groups in $\Sp$ are defined by those in $\Sp^{\N}$.)
	\medskip \\Let $X$ be a sequential spectrum. Then, there is an adjunction isomorphism \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Note that $1$ is on the right in the index (and it should be!).}
	\begin{align*}
		\tb{\alpha} : \pi_{n+k}(\Omega X_n) &= \pi_{n+k}(\map_*(S^1, X_n)) \xrightarrow{\ \sim \ } \pi_{n+k+1}(X_n)
		\\ [f:S^{n+k} \to \map_*(S^1, X_n)] &\mapsto [\hat{f} : S^{n+k+1} \to X_n, \ x \wedge t \mapsto f(x)(t)]
	\end{align*} 
	with $x \in S^{n+k}, t \in S^1$. (Schwede: \emph{What else could it be...})
	\medskip \\These \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright The reason is basically that we stabilize from the left and this map acts from the right.} bijections are compatible with stabilization! (Check.) Moreover, this is a group isomorphism for large enough $n+k$. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright 'Large enough' because I guess only then will we get group homomorphisms.}
	\medskip \\In the colimit over $n$ these bijections induce a group isomorphism $\alpha : \pi_k(\Omega X) \xrightarrow{\ \sim \ } \pi_{k+1}(X)$.
	\medskip \\The maps
	\[ - \wedge S^1 : \pi_{n+k}(X_n) \to \pi_{n+k+1}(X_n \wedge S^1), \ [f:S^{n+k} \to X_n] \mapsto [f \wedge S^1 : S^{n+k+1} \to X_n \wedge S^1] \]
	are also compatible with stabilization and they induce a homomorphism
	\[ \tb{- \wedge S^1} : \pi_k(X) \to \pi_{k+1}(X \wedge S^1), \]
	the \textbf{\tb{suspension homomorphism}}. Here $\tb{\Omega X}$ is the \textbf{\tb{loop spectrum}} and $\tb{X \wedge S^1}$ is the \textbf{\tb{suspended spectrum}}.
	{\scriptsize 
		\medskip \\Let us check this stabilization stuff once. The diagram in question is
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				\pi_{n+k}(X_n) \arrow[r, "-\wedge S^1"] \arrow[d, "S^1 \wedge -", swap] & \pi_{n+k+1}(X_n \wedge S^1) \arrow[d, "S^1 \wedge -"] & {[f]} \arrow[r, mapsto] \arrow[d, mapsto] & {[f \wedge S^1]} \arrow[d, mapsto]

				\\ \pi_{1+n+k}(X_{1+n}) \arrow[r, "- \wedge S^1", swap] & \pi_{1+n+k+1}(X_{1+n} \wedge S^1) & {[\sigma_n \circ (S^1 \wedge f)]} \arrow[r, mapsto] & {[\sigma_n \circ (S^1 \wedge f) \wedge S^1]}
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		which indeed commutes, so the universal property of $\colim$ induces a map $- \wedge S^1$. Here we see how important it is to keep track of the side we're suspending on.
	}	
	\begin{theorem} \label{theorem: loop, suspension}
		Let $X$ be a sequential spectrum.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item The loop and the suspension homomorphisms \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright There is a \LaTeX \ subtlety here. See \url{https://matheplanet.com/matheplanet/nuke/html/viewtopic.php?topic=258451}.}
			\[ \alpha : \pi_k(\Omega X) \to \pi_{k+1}(X) \quad \text{and} \quad \mathord- \wedge S^1 : \pi_k(X) \to  \pi_{k+1}(X \wedge S^1) \]
			are isomorphisms.
			\item The unit $\eta_X:X \to \Omega(X \wedge S^1)$ and the counit $\eps_X: (\Omega X) \wedge S^1 \to X$ of the adjunction are stable equivalences.\footnote{So this is also true for $S^n$ or $S^V$ instead of $S^1$ by iterating it.}
			\item An \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Will rather be useful later.} $O(m)$-action on $S^m$ induces the multiplication by the corresponding determinant on $\pi_{\ell}(X \wedge S^m)$ for all $\ell \in \Z$.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{theorem}

	\begin{proof}
		Too many non-trivial diagrams made it pretty exhausting to live-TeX -- please have some mercy for the live-TeX'ers out there! :-(\footnote{Little did I know that this was only the beginning of a series of gigantic diagrams...}
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item We've seen this for $\alpha$ above. Now $- \wedge S^1$.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Injectivity: Let $f:S^{n+k} \to X_n$ represent a class in $\pi_k(X)$ in the kernel of the suspension homomorphism. By increasing $n$, if necessary, we can assume WLOG that $f \wedge S^1 : S^{n+k+1} \to X_n \wedge S^1$ is null-homotopic. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright The basic deal is seeing in what way $- \wedge S^1$ and $S^1 \wedge -$ are compatible.} Then, so is the composite
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						S^{n+k+1} \arrow[d, "\chi_{n+k,1}", swap] \arrow[r, "f \wedge S^1"] & X_n \wedge S^1 \arrow[r, "\tau"]  & S^1 \wedge X_n \arrow[r, "\sigma_n"] & X_{1+n} 
						\\ S^{1+n+k} \arrow[rru, "S^1 \wedge f", bend right] \arrow[rrru, "\text{stabilization on $f$}", swap, bend right]
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center} 
				where $\tb{\chi_{n+k,1}}$ maps the last coordinate to the first and thus has degree $(-1)^{n+k}$. So $\sigma_n \circ (S^1 \wedge f)$ is nullhomotopic and hence $f$ represents the trivial element in $\pi_k(X)$.
				\item Surjectivity: Let $g : S^{n+k+1} \to X_n \wedge S^1$ be any map representing a genuine class in $\pi_k(X \wedge S^1)$. We define $f = \sigma_n \circ \tau \circ g$. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Oh, the indexing is a bit funky. I guess this is where the sign comes from.}
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						S^{n+k+1} \arrow[r, "f", dashed] \arrow[d, "g", swap] & X_{1+n}
						\\ X_n \wedge S^1 \arrow[r, "\tau", swap] & S^1 \wedge X_n \arrow[u, "\sigma_n", swap]
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				Then, $[f] \in \pi_k(X)$.
				\medskip \\Schwede: \emph{You might say, what is this guy doing? If we suspend, then surely this is OK. But there is a little bit to show since we suspend on different sides.}
				\begin{quote}
					\textbf{Claim.} $[f] \wedge S^1 = (-1)^{k+n} [g]$.
					\begin{proof}
						We consider the following diagram:
						\begin{center}
							\begin{tikzcd}
								S^{1+n+k+1} \arrow[d, "\chi_{1,n+k} \wedge S^1", swap] \arrow[rrd, "S^1 \wedge g", bend left]
								\\ S^{n+k+1+1} \arrow[rrd, "f \wedge S^1", swap, bend right] \arrow[r, "g \wedge S^1"] & X_n \wedge S^1 \wedge S^1 \arrow[r, "\tau \wedge S^1"] & S^1 \wedge X_n \wedge S^1 \arrow[d, "\sigma_n \wedge S^1"]
								\\ & & X_{1+n} \wedge S^1
							\end{tikzcd}
						\end{center}
						The upper part does not commute! 
						\medskip \\Schwede: \emph{My colleague Wolfgang Lück said: A diagram does not just commute because it is a diagram.} 
						\medskip \\The failure  is the two interchanges of the two $S^1$'s in the source and target in the upper triangle. These two automorphisms induce $(-1)$ in the source, and after suspension (\textbf{\#1.1}) also $(-1)$ on the target.
						{\scriptsize \medskip \\We need to show that the upper part of this diagram commutes up to homotopy. For this, we rather want to look at the following diagram:
							\begin{center}
								\begin{tikzcd}
									S^{1+n+k+1} \arrow[d, "\rho", swap] \arrow[rr, "S^1 \wedge g"] & & S^1 \wedge X_n \wedge S^1 \arrow[dd, "\tilde{\rho}"]
									\\ S^{1+n+k+1} \arrow[d, "{\chi_{1,n+k} \wedge S^1}", swap]
									\\ S^{n+k+1+1} \arrow[r, "g \wedge S^1", swap] & X_n \wedge S^1 \wedge S^1 \arrow[r, "\tau \wedge S^1", swap] & S^1 \wedge X_n \wedge S^1
								\end{tikzcd}
							\end{center}
						where $\rho$ and $\tilde{\rho}$ interchange the first and the last $S^1$-component. This diagram commutes: We can explicitly compute
						\begin{center}
							\begin{tikzcd}
								x \wedge y \wedge z \arrow[rr, mapsto] \arrow[d, mapsto] & & x \wedge g(y \wedge z) \arrow[dd, mapsto]
								\\ z \wedge y \wedge x \arrow[d, mapsto]
								\\ y \wedge z \wedge x \arrow[r, mapsto] & g(y \wedge z) \wedge x \arrow[r, mapsto] & g(y \wedge z)_2 \wedge g(y \wedge z)_1 \wedge x
							\end{tikzcd}
						\end{center}
						where $x,z \in S^1$ and $y \in S^{n+k}$ and $g(y \wedge z)_1 \wedge g(y \wedge z)_2 \in X_n \wedge S^1$ is suggestively denoted. On the other hand note that $\deg{\rho} = -1$, as $\rho$ acts as a transposition. We claim that $\tilde{\rho}$ acts as $-1$ on homotopy groups as well which amounts to the following diagram:
						\begin{center}
							\begin{tikzcd}
								S^1 \wedge X_n \wedge S^1 \arrow[rrr, bend right, "\tilde{\rho}", swap] \arrow[r, "S^1 \wedge \tau"] & S^1 \wedge S^1 \wedge X_n \arrow[r, "\tau \wedge X_n"] & S^1 \wedge S^1 \wedge X_n \arrow[r, "S^1 \wedge \tau"] & S^1 \wedge X_n \wedge S^1
							\end{tikzcd}
						\end{center}
						where these $\tau$'s commute the two factors (there is some abuse of notation). By construction this diagram commutes. Note that the $\tau$ in the middle has degree $-1$, so if we suspend once more, then $S^1 \wedge \tau \wedge X_n$ acts as $-1$ on homotopy groups by \textbf{\#1.1}. Hence, we obtain
						\begin{align*}
							(S^1 \wedge \tilde{\rho})_* &= (S^1 \wedge S^1 \wedge \tau)_* \circ (S^1 \wedge \tau \wedge X_n)_* \circ (S^1 \wedge S^1 \wedge \tau)_*
							\\ &= (-1) \cdot (S^1 \wedge S^1 \wedge \tau)_* \circ (S^1 \wedge S^1 \wedge \tau)_*
							\\ &= (-1) \id.
						\end{align*} 
						on $\pi_{1+\ell}(S^1 \wedge S^1 \wedge X_n \wedge S^1)$ for $\ell \geq 0$ where the second equality crucially uses \textbf{\#1.1}. That means that $\rho$ and $\tilde{\rho}$ both introduce a factor $(-1)$ on homotopy groups after suspending once and therefore, the diagram Schwede originally wrote down commutes on the level of homotopy groups after one suspension, i.e.
						\[ [(S^1 \wedge f \wedge S^1) \circ (S^1 \wedge \chi_{1,n+k} \wedge S^1)] = [(S^1 \wedge \sigma_n \wedge S^1) \circ (S^1 \wedge S^1 \wedge g)] \]
						in $\pi_{2+n+k+1}(S^1 \wedge X_{1+n} \wedge S^1)$. If we apply $\sigma_{1+n}$ on both sides, then we have the stabilization maps on both sides, so we can kill the stabilization in the colimit and obtain
						\[ (-1)^{n+k} [f \wedge S^1] = [(f \wedge S^1) \circ (\chi_{1,n+k} \wedge S^1)] = [(\sigma_n \wedge S^1) \circ (S^1 \wedge g)] = [g] \]
						as desired, although this was pretty long for something that Schwede only mentioned orally in a few sentences...
						}
					\end{proof}
				\end{quote}
				This claim ultimately shows that $g$ lies in the image of the map.
			\end{itemize}
			\item There are commutative triangles  (by adjunction)
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\pi_k(\Omega X) \arrow[rr, "\alpha"] \arrow[dr, "- \wedge S^1", swap] & & \pi_{k+1}(X)
					\\ & \pi_{k+1}((\Omega X) \wedge S^1) \arrow[ur, "(\eps_X)_*", swap]
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}

			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\pi_k(X) \arrow[rr, "- \wedge S^1"] \arrow[rd, "(\eta_X)_*", swap] & & \pi_{k+1}(X \wedge S^1) 
					\\ & \pi_k(\Omega(X \wedge S^1)) \arrow[ur, "\alpha", swap]
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			so $\eta_X$ is a stable equivalence.
			\item Let $A \in O(m)$ which induces $S^A : S^m \to S^m$ with $\deg(S^A) = \deg{A} \in \{-1,1 \}$. By (i) the map
			\[ - \wedge S^m : \pi_k(X) \to \pi_{k+m}(X \wedge S^m) \]
			is an isomorphism. So any class in $\pi_{k+m}(X \wedge S^m)$ has a representative of the form
			\[ f \wedge S^m : S^{n+k+m} \to X_n \wedge S^m \]
			for some $f:S^{n+k} \to X_n$. Then, \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright This reminds me of the Eckmann-Hilton argument (like the $2$-categorical swapping around thingy).}
			\begin{align*}
				(X \wedge S^A)_*[f \wedge S^m] &= [(X_n \wedge S^A) \circ (f \wedge S^m)] 
				\\ &= [(f \wedge S^m) \circ (S^{n+k} \wedge S^A)]
				\\ &= (\det{A}) [f \wedge S^m]
			\end{align*} 
			using \textbf{\#1.1}. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright So we have to choose $n+k \geq 1$.}
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proof}

	\begin{corollary} \label{corollary: stable equivalence}
		For every morphism of orthogonal or sequential spectra $f:X \to Y$ the following are equivalent: 
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item $f$ is a stable equivalence.
			\item $\Omega f$ is a stable equivalence.
			\item $f \wedge S^1$ is a stable equivalence.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{corollary}

	{\scriptsize \begin{proof}
			Combine naturality of the isomorphisms $\alpha, - \wedge S^1$ with \textbf{\ref{theorem: loop, suspension}}.
		\end{proof} }

	\begin{example}
		Let $V$ be an inner product space. We define a functor (enriched over $\Top_*$)
		\[ \tb{- \oplus V} : \Oc \to \Oc, \ U \mapsto U \oplus V \]
		with
		\[ \Oc(U,W) \to \Oc(U \oplus V, W \oplus V), \ (w, \phi) \mapsto ((w,0), \phi \oplus \id_V). \]
		Schwede: \emph{As soon as you realize that there is something to check, it is already checked.}\marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Namely that $(w,0) \perp \im(\phi \oplus \id_V)$.}
		\medskip \\The \textbf{\tb{$V$-th shift}} of an orthogonal spectrum $X$ is the composite \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright I guess it's called shift because on coordinates it's like $(\sh^m X)_n = X_{n+m}$.}
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				\sh^V X: \Oc \arrow[r, "- \oplus V"] & \Oc \arrow[r, "X"] & \Top_*.
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		This induces a functor $\tb{\sh^V} : \Sp \to \Sp$. More explicitly,
		\[ (\sh^V X)(U) = X(U \oplus V) \]
		with structure maps
		\[ \sigma_{UW}^{\sh^V X} : S^U \wedge (\sh^V X)(W) \to (\sh^V X)(U \oplus W) \]
		which is a map
		\[ S^U \wedge X(W \oplus V) \xrightarrow{\sigma^X_{U, W \oplus V}} X(U \oplus W \oplus V). \]
		Shifting \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Once from left and once from right. \tr{It's actually a bit weird: Where is the functor of spaces in these examples?}} commutes on the nose with all constructions of the form $F \circ - $ for $F: \Top_* \to \Top_*$. For example, \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Genuine equality!}
		\[ (\sh^V X) \wedge A = \sh^V(X \wedge A) \quad \text{or} \quad \map_*(A, \sh^V X) = \sh^V(\map_*(A, X)). \]
		There is also a canonical isomorphism $\sh^V(\sh^W X) \cong \sh^{V \oplus W} X$ with value at $U$ given by
		\[ (\sh^V(\sh^W X))(U) = (\sh^W X)(U \oplus V) = X((U \oplus V) \oplus W) \cong X(U \oplus (V \oplus W)) = (\sh^{V \oplus W}X)(U). \]
		Schwede: \emph{You don't want to insert a $(-1)$ in this isomorphism... which you could if you were mean.}
	\end{example}
	\noindent There is a natural morphism (check that it is a morphism!) $\tb{\lambda_X^V} : X \wedge S^V \to \sh^V X$ with components \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Note that $X(\tau_{UV})$ is where we use that $X$ is an orthogonal spectrum and not just a sequential spectrum.}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			(\lambda_X^V)_U : X(U) \wedge S^V \arrow[r, "\sigma_{UV}^{\op}", dashed] \arrow[d, "\tau", swap] & X(U \oplus V)
			\\ S^V \wedge X(U) \arrow[r, "\sigma_{VU}", swap] & X(V \oplus U) \arrow[u,"X(\tau_{UV})", swap]
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	Later (\textbf{\ref{theorem: lambda are stable equivalences}}): This morphism $\lambda_X^V$ is a stable equivalence!
	\medskip \\Special case $V = \R$: We write $\tb{\sh{X}} = \sh^{\R}{X}$ and $\tb{\lambda_X} = \lambda_X^{\R} : X \wedge S^1 \to \sh{X}$. 
	\medskip \\Warning: There are forgetful functors $\Sp \to \Sp^{\Sigma} \to \Sp^{\N}$. On these three categories, the $\lambda$-maps behave drastically differently and this is one reason that makes orthogonal spectra the nicest.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In $\Sp$ the $\lambda_X$ maps exist and are $\pi_*$-isomorphisms. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Here, $\pi_*$-isomorphisms are the maps which induce isomorphisms on $\pi_*$. (There is a distinction here because some models of spectra don't consider $\pi_*$-isomorphisms as their stable equivalences. \\And $\Sp^{\Sigma}$ are symmetric spectra.}
		\item In $\Sp^{\Sigma}$ the $\lambda_X$ maps exist but are not $\pi_*$-isomorphisms (see \textbf{\#3.2}).
		\item In $\Sp^{\N}$ there are no natural $\lambda$ maps at all.
	\end{itemize}
	Here is a popular mistake in the literature: Let $X \in \Sp^{\N}$. Consider $X \wedge S^1$ and $\sh{X}$ which make sense on sequential spectra. Have $(\sh{X})_n = X_{n+1}$, so
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			S^1 \wedge (\sh{X})_n \arrow[r, "\sigma_n^{\sh{X}}"] \arrow[d, equal] & (\sh{X})_{1+n} \arrow[d, equal]
			\\ S^1 \wedge X_{n+1} \arrow[r, "\sigma_{n+1}", swap] & X_{1+n+1}
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	Popular mistake (even in the published literature): The maps \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \raggedright Note that the indexing conventions are a bit all over the place in this attempt.}
	\[ \sigma_n : S^1 \wedge X_n = (X \wedge S^1)_n \to (\sh{X})_n = X_{1+n} \]
	define a morphism of sequential spectra. (They don't!) 
	\medskip \\This is an instance where diagrams don't commute because they're diagrams. Schwede has often seen this claimed in published papers while it is just not true and he invites us to check what it would mean to have commutativity. (One problem is already indicated by the $1+n+1$ or something.)
	{\scriptsize \medskip \\I feel like this is highly confusing but it should amount to something like this: The spectrum $S^1 \wedge X$ is given by $(S^1 \wedge X)_n = S^1 \wedge X_n$ with structure maps
		\[ S^1 \wedge S^1 \wedge X_n \xrightarrow{\tau \wedge X_n} S^1 \wedge S^1 \wedge X_n \xrightarrow{S^1 \wedge \sigma_n} S^1 \wedge X_{1+n} \]
	where the necessity of the flip\footnote{If one naively defines it without the flip, then there should be a valid commutativity. This would definitely be a different functor though (and I'm not sure if something goes wrong in the existence of this functor).} stems from the general case $A \wedge X$. To get a map $S^1 \wedge X \to \sh{X}$ we would want something like
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Sigma (S^1 \wedge X_n) \arrow[r, "(S^1 \wedge \sigma_n) \circ (\tau \wedge X_n)"] \arrow[d, "\Sigma \sigma_n", swap] & S^1 \wedge X_{1+n} \arrow[d, "\sigma_{1+n}"]
			\\ \Sigma X_{1+n} = \Sigma X_{n+1} \arrow[r, "\sigma_{n+1}", swap] & X_{1+n+1} = X_{2+n}
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	which should not be true in general. An indication that something should go wrong is that our indexing convention becomes incredibly messy (which is one factor that made it highly confusing for me).

	\subsection{Mapping cone sequence}
	There is a common theme in this chapter: We've seen that the suspension functor $\Sigma$ behaves well unstably for (co-)homology but not too well for homotopy. On the other hand, the stable setting fixes this issue. The mapping cone sequence is not unlike this theme: It behaves unstably well for (co-)homology and stably it also behaves well for homotopy.
	\medskip \\Let $f:A \to B$ be a continuous based map of based spaces. The \textbf{\tb{mapping cone}} is
	\[ \tb{Cf} = (A \wedge [0,1]) \cup_{A \times 1, f} B \]
	where $[0,1]$ is based at $0$. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Same homotopy type as unreduced cone for nice enough basepoint.} In particular, the reduced cone can be obtained by
	\[ A \wedge [0,1] = (A \times [0,1])/((A \times 0) \cup (a_0 \times [0,1])) = CA \]
	Anyhow, here is a picture of the unreduced mapping cone:
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{MappingCone}
		\caption{From \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapping_cone_(topology)}. The picture shows $f:X \to Y$. We furthermore need to identiy $a_0 \times [0,1]$ to get the based version.}
	\end{figure}
	\noindent We define 
	\[ t:[0,1] \to S^1 = \R \cup \{\infty \}, \ x \mapsto \frac{2x-1}{x(1-x)}. \]
	Schwede: \emph{Then, you sit down over your fireplace and contemplate about it a little bit...} 
	\medskip \\This descends to a homeomorphism \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Also collapse the face of the mapping cone. (Maybe draw a picture.)} $[0,1]/(0 \sim 1) \xrightarrow{\ \sim \ } S^1$. The mapping cone comes with natural maps
	\begin{align*}
		B \xrightarrow{i} Cf &\xrightarrow{p} A \wedge S^1,
		\\ a \wedge x &\mapsto a \wedge t(x),
		\\ b &\mapsto *.
	\end{align*}

		Let $f:A \to B$ be a continuous based map. 
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)] 
			\item The collapsed map

			\item Let $\beta : Z \to B$ be a based \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{Intuition?}} continuous map such that $i \circ \beta : Z \to Cf$ is null-homotopic. Then, there is a map $h:Z \wedge S^1 \to A \wedge S^1$ such that $(f \wedge S^1) \circ h : Z \wedge S^1 \to B \wedge S^1$ is homotopic to $\beta \wedge S^1$.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{lemma}
	\noindent Schwede: \emph{About the sign in the rotation axiom of triangulated categories: You might wonder where the sign comes from. Well, it comes up because if you prove it, it comes up.}
	
	\begin{proof}
		We can read up the explicit maps in the literature.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item A homotopy inverse to $* \cup p$ is 
			\[ r:A \wedge S^1 \to (B \wedge [0,1]) \cup_i Cf, \ a \wedge x \mapsto \begin{cases}
				a \wedge 2x \quad &\text{in }Cf \text{ for } 0 \leq x \leq \frac12,
				\\ f(a) \wedge (2-2x) &\text{in } B \wedge [0,1] \text{ for } \frac12 < x \leq 1
			\end{cases} \]
			There are explicit homotopies between $* \cup p$ and $r$ to the respective identities. Here is one of them: We have
			\begin{align*}
				[0,1] \times (B \wedge [0,1]) &\to Ci
				\\ (t,b \wedge x) &\mapsto b \wedge (1-t)x \quad \text{in } B \wedge [0,1] \subseteq Ci.
			\end{align*}
			along with
			\begin{align*}
				[0,1] \times (A \wedge [0,1]) &\to Ci
				\\ (t, a \wedge x) &\mapsto \begin{cases}
					a \wedge (1+t)x \quad & \text{in $Cf$ for } 0 \leq x \leq \frac{1}{1+t},
					\\ f(a) \wedge (2-x(1+t)) &\text{in $B \wedge [0,1]$ for } \frac{1}{1+t} \leq x \leq 1.
				\end{cases}
			\end{align*}
			Schwede: \emph{Don't copy the formulas... Well. This is a free country, so you're of course allowed to copy them...} (Sorry, I copied them.)
			\item There are explicit homotopies.
			\item Let \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright The smash product collapses $Z$ at $0$, so it really starts at the basepoint.} $H: Z \wedge [0,1] \to Cf$ be a continuous map witnessing that $\beta \circ i$ is null-homotopic, i.e. $H(z \wedge 1) = i(\beta(z))$. Then, via the diagram
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}

					\\ Z \wedge S^1 \arrow[r, dashed, "\exists ! h"] & A \wedge S^1
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			the composite $p_A \circ H$ factors uniquely as $h \circ p_Z$ for $h:Z \wedge S^1 \to A \wedge S^1$.
			\begin{quote}
				\textbf{Claim.} $(f \wedge S^1) \circ h \simeq \beta \wedge S^1$.
				\begin{proof}
					This follows from 
					\[ (f \wedge S^1) \circ h \circ (* \cup p_Z) \simeq (\beta \wedge S^1) \circ (* \cup p_Z) \]
					because $(* \cup p_Z) : CZ \cup_Z CZ \to Z \wedge S^1$ is a homotopy equivalence using (i) for $\id_Z$. Let's manipulate:
					\begin{align*}
						(f \wedge S^1) \circ h \circ (* \cup p_Z) &= (f \wedge S^1) \circ (* \cup p_A) \circ ((\beta \wedge [0,1]) \cup H)
						\\ &\overset{\text{(ii)}}{\simeq} (B \wedge \tau) \circ (p_B \cup *) \circ ((\beta \wedge [0,1]) \cup H)
						\\ &= (B \wedge \tau) \circ (\beta \wedge S^1) \circ (p_Z \cup *)
						\\ &= (\beta \wedge S^1) \circ (Z \wedge \tau) \circ (p_Z \cup *)
						\\ &\overset{\text{(ii)}}{\simeq} (\beta \wedge S^1) \circ (* \cup p_Z)
					\end{align*}
					where the equalities are checked on both parts of the union separately.
				\end{proof}
			\end{quote}
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proof}
	\noindent Now let $f:X \to Y$ be a morphism of orthogonal or sequential spectra. The \textbf{\tb{mapping cone $Cf$}} is a pushout
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			X \arrow[r, "f"] \arrow[d, "- \wedge 1", swap] & Y \arrow[d]

		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	i.e. we take the mapping cone objectwise/levelwise. 
	{\scriptsize \medskip \\Moreover, note that the mapping cone forms a homotopy pushout square with the following diagram on the left:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				X \arrow[r, "f"] \arrow[d] & Y \arrow[d] & X \arrow[r] \arrow[d, rightarrowtail] & Y \arrow[d]

				\\ & & *
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		This is because of the factorization of $X \to *$ through the mapping cylinder to obtain a cofibration up to weak equivalence as demonstrated in the right diagram. So it's also reasonable to call $Cf$ the homotopy cofiber of $f$. \medskip \\

	\begin{proposition} \label{prop: mapping cone LES}
		For every morphism of sequential spectra $f:X \to Y$, the sequence

		\end{center}
		is exact.
	\end{proposition}

	\begin{proof}
		Let's go.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Exactness at $\pi_k(Y)$: The  composite $i_* \circ f_* = (i \circ f)_*$ is the trivial homomorphism because $i \circ f$ is levelwise constant at the basepoint. 
			{\scriptsize \medskip \\We claim $* \simeq i \circ f : X \to Cf$ levelwise. Indeed, this is realized by the homotopy $H:X \times [0,1] \to Cf, \ (x,t) \mapsto [x,t]$. (I'm not sure what Schwede meant. Maybe I have to pay more attention to make sure that this is not only levelwise trivial but also globally.)
				\medskip \\
			}
			Now let $ \beta : S^{n+k} \to Y_n$ represent an element in the kernel of $i_* : \pi_k(Y) \to \pi_k(Cf)$. WLOG (by replacing $\beta$ by an later representative in the colimit system) $i_n \circ \beta : S^{n+k} \to Y_n \to Cf_n$ is nullhomotopic. Then, \textbf{\ref{lemma: unstable mapping cone}}(iii) provides a continuous based map $h:S^{n+k+1} \to X_n \wedge S^1$ such that $(f_n \wedge S^1) \circ h \simeq \beta \wedge S^1$. The composite
			\[ \tilde{h} : S^{1+n+k} \xrightarrow{\chi_{1,n+k}} S^{n+k+1} \xrightarrow{h} X_n \wedge S^1 \xrightarrow{\text{twist}} S^1 \wedge X_n \]
			is such that $(S^1 \wedge f_n) \circ \tilde{h} \simeq S^1 \wedge \beta$.
			{\scriptsize \medskip \\Consider the diagram
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						S^{1+n+k} \arrow[r, "{\chi_{1,n+k}}"] \arrow[d, equal] \arrow[rrrr, "(S^1 \wedge f_n) \circ \tilde{h}", bend left] & S^{n+k+1} \arrow[d, equal] \arrow[rr, "(f_n \wedge S^1) \circ h"] & & X_n \wedge S^1 \arrow[d, equal] \arrow[r, "\tau"] & S^1 \wedge X_n \arrow[d, equal]
						\\ S^{1+n+k} \arrow[r, "{\chi_{1,n+k}}", swap] \arrow[rrrr, "S^1 \wedge \beta", swap, bend right] & S^{n+k+1} \arrow[rr, "\beta \wedge S^1", swap] & & X_n \wedge S^1 \arrow[r, "\tau", swap] & S^1 \wedge X_n
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
			The left square and the right square commute on the nose and the middle square commutes up to homotopy as exhibited above. So indeed $(S^1 \wedge f_n) \circ \tilde{h} \simeq S^1 \wedge \beta$. \medskip \\
			}
			Then, $\sigma_n \circ \tilde{h} : S^{1+n+k} \to X_{1+n}$ represents a class in $\pi_k(X)$ such that
			\[ f_*[\sigma_n \circ \tilde{h}] = [f_{1+n} \circ \sigma_n \circ \tilde{h}] = [\sigma_n \circ (S^1 \wedge f_n) \circ \tilde{h}] = [\sigma_n \circ (S^1 \wedge \beta)] = [\beta] \]
			where we use that $f$ is a morphism of spectra. So $\ker{i_*} = \im{f_*}$.
			\item Exactness at $\pi_k(Cf)$: We compare \marginpar{\tiny We basically construct a long homotopy cofiber sequence so it is symmetrical at every point.} the LES for $f$ to the LES for $i_f:Y \to Cf$ with a rotation. The collapsed maps provide a levelwise homotopy equivalence (\textbf{\ref{lemma: unstable mapping cone}}) \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright The above map $* \cup p$ is actually even a homotopy equivalence of spectra: Everything was natural.}
			\[ * \cup p_f : Ci_f = CY \cup_{i_f} Cf \to X \wedge S^1, \]
			so it induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups.
			\medskip \\Consider the diagram
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					Cf \arrow[r, "i_{i_f}"] \arrow[dr, "p_f", swap] & Ci_f \arrow[d, "* \cup p_f"] \arrow[r, "p_{i_f}"] & Y \wedge S^1 \arrow[d, "Y \wedge \tau"] 
					\\ & X \wedge S^1 \arrow[r, "f \wedge S^1", swap] & Y \wedge S^1
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			where $i_f : Y \to Cf$ is the natural inclusion. The left diagram commutes on the nose and the right diagram commutes up to homotopy (\textbf{\ref{lemma: unstable mapping cone}}). So it induces a commutative diagram of abelian groups
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\pi_k(Y) \arrow[r, "(i_f)_*"] \arrow[d, equal] & \pi_k(Cf) \arrow[d, equal] \arrow[r, "(i_{i_f})_*"] & \pi_k(Ci_f) \arrow[r, "\delta"] \arrow[d, "{(- \wedge S^{-1}) \circ (* \cup p_f)}"] & \pi_{k-1}(Y) \arrow[d, "-1"]

				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			The middle square commutes by the commutative triangle above and the right square commutes by the commutative square (up to homotopy) above. The right two vertical arrows are isomorphisms and the upper part is exact in $\pi_k(Cf)$ by the previous part for $i_f:Y \to Cf$. So the lower diagram is exact in $\pi_k(Cf)$.

	\noindent Recall: A continuous map $f:A \to B$ is an \textbf{\tb{$h$-cofibration}} if it has the HEP. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright This terminology is somewhat more often used in stable homotopy theory.} In this case the quotient map

	\medskip \\Now let $f:X \to Y$ be a morphism of spectra that is levelwise an $h$-cofibration. Then, the quotient morphism $Cf \to Y/X$ is levelwise a homotopy equivalence, so it is in particular a stable equivalence. 
	{\scriptsize \medskip \\In the viewpoint of homotopy pushouts: Since $f$ is already a cofibration, the pushout $Y/X = Y \amalg_X *$ is already a homotopy pushout, so we get $Y/X \approx Cf$ by the homotopy invariance of homotopy pushouts. \medskip \\
	}
	We define a connecting homomorphism $\tb{\delta} : \pi_{k+1}(Y/X) \to \pi_k(X)$ defined via
	\begin{center}

	Note the abuse of notation. There will be multiple instances of abuses of notation in this lecture.
	\begin{corollary} \label{corollary: LES with quotients}
		If $f:X \to Y$ is levelwise is an $h$-cofibration, the following sequence is exact:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}

	\end{corollary}
	\noindent Now, stably, the difference \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright It hopefully should: In a stable $\infty$-category fiber and cofiber sequences agree.} between cones and fibers sort of vanishes.
	\medskip \\Recall: The \textbf{\tb{homotopy fiber}} of a based continuous map $f:A \to B$ is the pullback \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright So it's some $a \in A$ with a based map $\lambda : [0,1] \to B$ that lifts $a$ in the endpoint. \\ In other words, it's sort of the collection of paths to the fiber of $a$.
	\\It's somehow the fiber of $E_f \to B$ (see \textbf{Hatcher, p. 407}).} 
	\[ \tb{Ff} = * \times_B B^{[0,1]} \times_B A = \{(\lambda,a) \in B^{[0,1]} \times A : \lambda(0) = *, \ \lambda(1) = f(a) \}. \]
	{\scriptsize In $\Top_*$ this is the fiber product
		\begin{center}

				\\ {B^{[0,1]}} \arrow[r, "{(\ev_0, \ev_1)}", swap] & B \times B
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
	Moreover, note that the homotopy fiber forms a homotopy pullback square with the following diagram on the left:
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			& & & A \arrow[d, "\approx"]
			\\ Ff \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & A  \arrow[d, "f"] & Ff \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & Ef \arrow[d, twoheadrightarrow]
			\\ *_B \arrow[r] & B & *_B \arrow[r] & B
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	This is because of the factorization of $f$ through the mapping path space to obtain a fibration up to weak equivalence as demonstrated in the right diagram. \medskip \\
	}\noindent This comes with natural maps \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{Is this supposed to map to $Ff$? Also, I guess the first isomorphism is needed because one often rather defines $\Omega B \subseteq B^I$ as the loops in there.}}
	\begin{align*}

		\\ (\mu :S^1 \to B) &\mapsto (\mu \circ t, *)
	\end{align*}
	Now, let $f:X \to Y$ be a morphism of sequential/orthogonal spectra. Its \textbf{\tb{homotopy fiber}} is the pullback 
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}

	The connection morphism $\tb{\delta} : \pi_{1+k}(Y) \to \pi_k(Ff)$ is defined as the composite \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{Connecting homomorphisms are weird. Is there a unifying way of talking about them?}}
	\[ \pi_{1+k}(Y) \xrightarrow{\alpha^{-1}} \pi_k(\Omega Y) \xrightarrow{i_*} \pi_k(Ff). \]
	(Note the abuse of notation again.) We now construct a morphism $(Ff) \wedge S^1 \to Cf$.
	\medskip \\We start with a continuous based map $f:A \to B$ and define
	\begin{align*}
		\ol{h} : Ff \times [0,1] &\to (A \wedge [0,1]) \cup_f B
		\\ (\lambda, a, t) &\mapsto \begin{cases}
			a \wedge 2t \quad & 0 \leq t \leq \frac12,
			\\ \lambda(2-2t) & \frac12 \leq t \leq 1.
		\end{cases}
	\end{align*}
	Note that $\lambda(2-2t)$ swaps around the interval. There will be signs coming up soon and that's where it comes from. We can check that the cases are compatible at $t = \frac12$ and that $\ol{h}(\lambda, a, 0) = \ol{h}(\lambda, a, 1)$. The latter implies that $\ol{h}$ factors as 
	\begin{center}

		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	Do this levelwise to obtain a morphism of spectra. (Check naturality!)
	
	\begin{proposition} \label{prop: homotopy fiber LES}

		\medskip \\To show that $h:(Ff) \wedge S^1 \to Cf$ is a stable equivalence, it suffices to show that 
		\[ h_* \circ (- \wedge S^1) : \pi_k(Ff) \to \pi_{k+1}(Cf) \]

			\begin{proof}
				Let's start with the right square. The composite \marginpar{\tiny \tr{Think about the geometry of this.}}
				\[ (Ff) \wedge S^1 \xrightarrow{h} Cf \xrightarrow{p} X \wedge S^1 \]

				Then,
				\begin{align*}
					\delta \circ h_* \circ (- \wedge S^1) &= (- \wedge S^{-1}) \circ p_* \circ h_* \circ (- \wedge S^1)
					\\ &= (- \wedge S^1) \circ (q \wedge S^1)_* \circ (- \wedge S^1)
					\\ &= (- \wedge S^{-1}) \circ (- \wedge S^1) \circ q_*
					\\ &= q_*.
				\end{align*}
				Time to attack the left square. We need \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{Should use different $i$'s in notation.}} that the following \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{Think about the geometry of this.}} commutes up to homotopy: 
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}

					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				There is \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright This homotopy is from Daniel. The homotopy on the blackboard didn't make any sense.} an explicit homotopy from $\iota \circ \eps$ to $h \circ (i \wedge \tau)$ given by
				\[ [0,1] \times (\Omega Y \wedge S^1) \to Cf, \ (t, \omega \wedge x) \mapsto \begin{cases}

					\\ * & 1 - \frac{t}{2} \leq x \leq 1.
				\end{cases} \]
				Then,
				\begin{align*}
					h_*(\delta(g) \wedge S^1) &= h_*(i_*(\alpha^{-1}(g)) \wedge S^1)
					\\ &= h_*((i \wedge S^1)_* (\alpha^{-1}(g) \wedge S^1))
					\\ &= - i_*(\eps_* (\alpha^{-1}(g) \wedge S^1))
					\\ &= - i_*(g)
				\end{align*}
				for $g \in \pi_{k+1}(Y)$.\footnote{Note that in the notation we're somewhat tacitly interchanging between the class of a morphism and the morphism itself. (Schwede wrote $y$ instead of $g$ which confused me a little since it made me think of a concrete element in $Y$ instead of a function into $Y$.)}
				{\scriptsize \medskip \\Let's concretely check $\eps_* (\alpha^{-1}(g) \wedge S^1) = g$. Write $g = [\tilde{g} : S^{n+k+1} \to Y]$. Indeed, after unravelling the definitions we have
				\[
					\eps \circ (\alpha^{-1}(\tilde{g}) \wedge S^1)(s,t) = \eps(\underbrace{(o \mapsto \tilde{g}(s,o))}_{S^1 \to Y}, t) = \tilde{g}(s,t).

		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item For every family $\{X^i \}_{i \in I}$ of sequential spectra the natural map
			\[ \bigoplus_{i \in I} \pi_k(X^i) \to \pi_k \left( \bigvee_{i \in I} X^i \right) \]
			is an isomorphism.
			\item For every finite indexing set $I$, the canonical map 
			\[ \pi_k \left( \prod_{i \in I} X^i \right) \to \prod_{i \in I} \pi_k(X^i) \]
			is an isomorphism.
			\item If $I$ is finite, the natural map $\bigvee_{i \in I} X^i \to \prod_{i \in I} X^i$ is a stable equivalence. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright This basically shows that $\SH$ is additive which is the first step of the triangulation on $\SH$.}
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proposition}

	\begin{proof}
		Most of the work in (i).
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item We start with the special case of two summands $A,B$. We consider the long exact mapping cone sequence associated to the inclusion $i_A : A \to A \vee B$:
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\dots \arrow[r] & \pi_k(A) \arrow[r, "i_A"] & \pi_k(A \vee B) \arrow[r, "(i_{i_A})_*"] & \pi_k(C(i_A)) \arrow[r, "\delta"] & \pi_{k-1}(A) \arrow[r] & \dots
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			Note that there is a retraction $r:A \vee B \to A$ of $i_A$. This implies $\delta = 0$, so the retraction $r:A \vee B \to A$ to $i_A$ decomposes the LES to SES's. Moreover, \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Alternatively, $i_A$ is a cofibration, so the third term can be taken as $(A \vee B)/A = (A \vee B) \amalg_A * = (A \amalg B) \amalg_A * \cong B$.} note that there is a homotopy equivalence $C(i_A) \cong (CA) \vee B \simeq B$. So we obtain split SES's
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					0 \arrow[r] & \pi_k(A) \arrow[r, "(i_A)_*"] & \pi_k(A \vee B) \arrow[l, bend left, "r_*"] \arrow[r, " \operatorname{proj}_B"] & \pi_k(B) \arrow[r] \arrow[l, "(i_B)_*", bend left] & 0
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			Now we consider arbitrary $I$. We consider
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\bigoplus_{i \in I} \pi_k(X^i) \arrow[r] \arrow[rr, bend right, "\text{canonical}", swap, hookrightarrow] & \pi_k \left( \bigvee_{i \in I} X^i \right) \arrow[r] & \prod_i \pi_k(X^i)
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			In $\Ab$ this canonical map is always injective. Thus, also $\bigoplus_{i \in I} \pi_k(X^i) \injArrow \pi_k \left( \bigvee_{i \in I} X^i \right)$.
			\medskip \\For surjectivity we consider a continuous map $f:S^{n+k} \to \bigvee_{i \in I} X_n^i$ that represents a class in $\pi_k \left( \bigvee_{i \in I} X^i \right)$. Because $S^{n+k}$ is compact\marginpar{\tiny \raggedright There are some point-set topological technicalities here.}, there is a finite subset $J \subseteq I$ such that $\im{f} \subseteq \bigvee_{i \in J} X_n^i$. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright I guess now we use that we already now surjectivity in the finite case by the above. We need to conclude by seeing that restricting to a finite indexing set is natural.}
			\medskip \\Using the naturality diagram
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\bigoplus_{i \in J} \pi_k(X^i) \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & \pi_k \left( \bigvee_{i \in J} X^i \right) \arrow[d]
					\\ \bigoplus_{i \in I} \pi_k(X^i) \arrow[r] & \pi_k \left( \bigvee_{i \in I} X^i \right).
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			we deduce surjectivity.
			\item For all $k,n$ such that $k+n \geq 0$, the natural map
			\[ \prod_{i \in I} \pi_{n+k}(X_n^i) \leftarrow \pi_{n+k} \left( \left( \prod_{i \in I} X^i \right)_n \right) = \pi_{n+k} \left( \prod_{i \in I} X_n^i \right) \]
			is bijective. Since finite products commute with filtered colimits, we also get a product decomposition in the colimit over $n \to \infty$.
			\item Consider
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\bigoplus_{i \in I} \pi_k(X^i) \arrow[r, "\sim"] \arrow[rrr, "\sim", swap, bend right] & \pi_k \left( \bigvee_{i \in I} X^i \right) \arrow[r] & \pi_k \left( \prod_{i \in I} X^i \right) \arrow[r, "\sim"] & \prod_{i \in I} \pi_k(X^i)
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			where the first isomorphism is by (i), the latter isomorphism is by (ii) and the composition is an isomorphism since finite direct sums agree with finite products in $\Ab$.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proof}

	\noindent Maps from compact space to filtered colimit sometimes/often end in a finite part of the colimit system but they probably don't always. Schwede said that this was something that he understood wrong for quite a while in his career and told us to be careful about mathoverflow. (It was more spectacular in-person but I didn't have time to transcribe his wording.)
	
	\begin{example}[The finiteness hypotheses on $I$ in (ii) cannot be dropped]
		Let $\tb{\S^{\leq i}}$ be the \textbf{\tb{truncated sphere spectrum}}
		\[ (\S^{\leq i})_n = \begin{cases}
			S^n \quad & n \leq i,
			\\ * & n > i.
		\end{cases} \]
		Then, $\pi_k(\S^{\leq i}) = 0$ for all $k,i$ (eventually in the colimit system, we are just considering homotopy groups of $*$). In particular, $\prod_{k \in \N} \pi_k(\S^{\leq i}) = 0$.
		\medskip \\On the other hand,
		\begin{align*}
			\pi_0 \left( \prod_{i \geq 0} \S^{\leq i} \right) &= \colim_n  \pi_n \left( \prod_{i \geq 0} \S_n^{\leq i} \right)
			\\ &= \colim_n \prod_{i \geq n} \pi_n(S^n)
			\\ &\cong \colim_n \prod_{i \geq n} \Z
		\end{align*}
		But there is a diagram
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				\pi_n \left( \prod_{i \geq 0} \S^{\leq i}_n \right) \arrow[d, swap] \arrow[r, equal] & \prod_{i \geq n} \pi_n(S^n) \arrow[r, equal] & \prod_{i \geq n} \Z \arrow[d, "\operatorname{proj}"]
					\\ \pi_{n+1} \left( \prod_{i \geq 0} \S^{\leq i}_{n+1} \right) \arrow[r, equal] & \prod_{i \geq n+1} \pi_{n+1}(S^{n+1}) \arrow[r, equal] & \prod_{i \geq n+1} \Z 
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		So \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{How do you see the last isomorphism rigorously?}}
		\[ \pi_0 \left( \prod_{i \geq 0} \S^{\leq i} \right) = \colim_n \pi_n \left( \prod_{i \geq 0} \S^{\leq i}_n \right) \cong \frac{\prod_{k \in \N} \Z}{\bigoplus_{k \in \N} \Z} \neq 0. \]
		Therefore, the map
		\[ \pi_0 \left(\prod_{i \geq 0} \S^{\leq i} \right) \to \prod_{i \geq 0} \pi_0 \left(\S_n^{\leq i} \right) \]
		is not an isomorphism.
	\end{example}

	\begin{proof}
		We do this mostly to have this written on the board.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item Write $\tb{X^{\infty}} = \colim_{m \geq 0} X^m$. Let $f:S^{n+k} \to X_n^{\infty}$ be a continuous based map that represents a class in $\pi_k(X^{\infty})$. Colimits are computed levelwise, so $X_n^{\infty} = \colim_m X_n^m$. Since the maps $e_n^m : X_n^m \to X_n^{m+1}$ are closed embeddings, $f$ factors through $X_n^m$ for some finite $m$\footnote{We use that the $S^{n+k}$ is compact and the target spaces are weak Hausdorff. (This is some point-set topology fact.)} So $f$ is in the image of $\pi_k(X^m) \to \pi_k(X^{\infty})$.

	\begin{proof}[Proof of (v)]

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Case 1: Suppose $f$ is levelwise an $h$-cofibration (hence so is $g$\footnote{Recall that cofibrations are closed under pushouts.}). The LES for the homotopy groups (\textbf{\ref{corollary: LES with quotients}}) of $f$ shows

	\begin{proof}[Proof of (vi)]
		The functor $- \wedge K$ commutes with mapping cones:
		\begin{quote}
			\textbf{Claim.} For $f:X \to Y$ we have $(Cf) \wedge K \cong C(f \wedge K)$.
			\begin{proof}
				I want to use that $- \wedge K$ commutes with colimits. We apply $- \wedge K$ to the cocone given by $Cf$ to obtain
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						X \wedge K \arrow[r, "f \wedge K"] \arrow[d] & Y \wedge K \arrow[d]
						\\ X \wedge I \wedge K \arrow[r] & Cf \wedge K.
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				Using $X \wedge I \wedge K \cong X \wedge K \wedge I$ we get the pushout $C(f \wedge K)$.
			\end{proof}
		\end{quote} So the LES for mapping cones (\textbf{\ref{prop: mapping cone LES}}) reduces the claim to the following special case: If $X$ has trivial homotopy groups, then so does $X \wedge K$. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright You can do this reduction for any functor which commutes with mapping cones.}
		{\scriptsize \medskip \\The LES gives $\dots \to \pi_k(X) \to \pi_k(Y) \to \pi_k(Cf) \to \pi_{k-1}(X) \to \dots$. If and only if $f$ is a stable equivalence, we have $\pi_k(Cf) = 0$ for every $k$. But similarly $f \wedge K$ is a stable equivalence if and only if $C(f \wedge K) = (Cf) \wedge K$ has trivial homotopy groups.}
		\medskip \\We choose a CW structure \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{Which result was it again that makes this possible?}} in which the basepoint is a $0$-cell with skeleta $K_n$. We show by induction that $X \wedge K_n$ has trivial homotopy groups. The case $n = -1$ is because $X \wedge * = *$.\footnote{Essentially $K_{-1} = \{k_0 \} \subseteq K_0 \subseteq K_1$.}
		\medskip \\Now let $n \geq 0$. Then, $K_n/K_{n-1} \cong \bigvee_{i \in I} S^n$. So
		\begin{align*}
			\pi_k \left( \frac{X \wedge K_n}{X \wedge K_{n-1}} \right) &\cong \pi_k(X \wedge (K_n/K_{n-1})) 
			\\ &\cong \pi_k \left(X \wedge \bigvee_{i \in I} S^n \right) 
			\\ &\cong \pi_k \left( \bigvee_{i \in I} (X \wedge S^n) \right) 
			\\ &\cong \bigoplus_{i \in I} \pi_k(X \wedge S^n) 
			\\ &\cong \bigoplus_{i \in I} \pi_{k-n}(X) 
			\\ &= 0.
		\end{align*} 
		where the first and third step uses that $X \wedge -$ as a left adjoint commutes with colimits. We also use \textbf{\ref{prop: direct sums, products, wedges of spectra}} and \textbf{\ref{theorem: loop, suspension}}.
		\medskip \\The morphism $K_{n-1} \to K_n$ is an $h$-cofibration, as we have CW complexes. So $X \wedge K_{n-1} \to X \wedge K_n$ is also an levelwise an $h$-cofibration. Hence, the homotopy group LES of the strict cofiber\footnote{Strict cofiber means quotient.} (\textbf{\ref{corollary: LES with quotients}})
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				\cdots \arrow[r] & \pi_k(X \wedge K_{n-1}) \arrow[r] & \pi_k(X \wedge K_n) \arrow[r] & \pi_k \left(\frac{X \wedge K_n}{X \wedge K_{n-1}} \right) \arrow[r] & \pi_{k-1}(X \wedge K_{n-1}) \arrow[r] & \cdots

		\[ \pi_k(X \wedge K) \cong \colim_n \pi_k(X \wedge K_n) = 0. \]
	\end{proof}

	{\scriptsize \noindent In the proof we have used the following fact:
		\begin{quote}
			\textbf{Claim.} Let $X \in \Top_*$. The functor $X \wedge -$ preserves $h$-cofibrations.
			
			\begin{proof}
				Let $f:A \to B$ be an $h$-cofibration. Equivalently (see discussion after \textbf{\ref{def: h-cofibration of spectra}}), there exists a retraction $r$ of
				\[ (A \wedge [0,1]_+) \cup_f B \to B \wedge [0,1]_+. \]
				So we have maps $(A \wedge [0,1]_+) \cup_f B \leftrightarrows B \wedge [0,1]_+$. Applying $X \wedge -$ yields
				\[ ((X \wedge A) \wedge [0,1]_+) \cup_{X \wedge f} (X \wedge B) \cong X \wedge ((A \wedge [0,1]_+) \cup_f B) \leftrightarrows X \wedge (B \wedge [0,1]_+) \cong (X \wedge B) \wedge [0,1]_+ \]
				since $X \wedge -$ commutes with colimits as a left adjoint. Therefore, a retraction remains after $X \wedge -$, so $X \wedge f$ is an $h$-cofibration as well.
			\end{proof}
		\end{quote}
	}

	\begin{proof}[Proof of (vii)]
		Let $K$ be a finite based CW complex. Then, $\map_*(K,-)$ commutes with homotopy fibers: 
		\begin{quote}
			\textbf{Claim.} Let $f:X \to Y$, then we have $\map_*(K,Ff) \cong F(\map_*(K, f))$.
		\end{quote} So the LES for homotopy fibers (\textbf{\ref{prop: homotopy fiber LES}}) reduces the statement to the following special case: If $X$ has trivial homotopy groups, then so does $\map_*(K,X)$.
		\medskip \\We argue by induction over the number of cells in $K$. If $K = \{k_0 \}$ consists only of the basepoint, then $\map_*(*, X) = *$ which has trivial homotopy groups. Else, suppose that $L$ is obtained from $K$ by attaching an $n$-cell, and assume the claim for $K$. Then, the restriction map $\map_*(L,X) \to \map_*(K,X)$ is levelwise a Serre fibration. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright I guess the dual argument to the above shows that $\map_*(-,X)$ turns $h$-cofibrations into Serre fibrations.} So we get an LES \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright This only works for finite CW complexes because $L/K$ as an infinite wedge would turn into an infinite product but $\pi_k$ does not preserve infinite products.}
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				\cdots \arrow[r] & {\pi_k(\text{fiber of } \map_*(L,X) \to \map_*(K,X))} \arrow[r] & {\pi_k(\map_*(L,X))} \arrow[r] & {\pi_k(\map_*(K,X))} 
				\\ & {\pi_k(\map_*(L/K, X))} \arrow[u, "\wr"] & & 0 \arrow[u, equal]
				\\ & {\pi_k(\map_*(S^n, X))} \arrow[u, "\wr"]
				\\ & \pi_{k+n}(X) \arrow[u, "\wr"]
				\\ & 0 \arrow[u, equal]
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		and thus $\pi_k(\map_*(L,X)) = 0$. (The first isomorphism uses that $\map_*(-,X)$ preserves limits; but caution: This is a contravariant functor!)
	\end{proof}

	\section{Ring and module spectra}
	Next to equivariant stable homotopy theory, this is one part where orthogonal spectra are more convenient than sequential spectra. The problem is that $\Sp^{\N}$ does not admit a $\wedge$ which exhibits a symmetric monoidal structure on $\Sp^{\N}$ and $\Ho(\Sp^{\N})$. Symmetric spectra are problematic because their $\pi_*$-isomorphisms are not the suitable weak equivalences.
	
	\subsection{First definitions}
	
	We define ring spectra (which in my eyes is a more-or-less peculiar definition because it is not obvious that this defines something like a ring object in $\Sp$).
	
	\begin{definition}
		An \textbf{\tb{orthogonal ring spectrum}} is an orthogonal spectrum $R$ equipped with $(O(V) \times O(W))$-equivariant multiplication maps
		\[ \mu_{VW} : R(V) \wedge R(W) \to R(V \oplus W) \]
		and a unit $\iota \in R(0)$\footnote{I.e. $\iota : S^0 \to R(0)$ by the generalized elements viewpoint.} that satisfy
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Associativity: For all inner product spaces $U,V,W$ the following diagram commutes: \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Note that there should actually still be some associativity isomorphisms concerning $\wedge$ and $\oplus$.}
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					R(U) \wedge R(V) \wedge R(W) \arrow[rr, "{ R(U) \wedge \mu_{VW}}"] \arrow[d, swap, "\mu_{UV} \wedge R(W)"] & & R(U) \wedge R(V \oplus W) \arrow[d, "\mu_{U, V \oplus W}"]
					\\ R(U \oplus V) \wedge R(W) \arrow[rr, "\mu_{U \oplus V, W}", swap] & & R(U \oplus V \oplus W)
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			\item Unitality: For all inner product spaces $V,W$, the composite \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{It's a bit weird that this involves the structure maps and is not per se what I would have expected from a ring object.}}
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					S^V \wedge R(W) \arrow[r, "- \wedge \iota \wedge -"] & S^V \wedge R(0) \wedge R(W) \arrow[rr, "{\sigma_{V,0} \wedge R(W)}"] & & R(V) \wedge R(W) \arrow[r, "\mu_{VW}"] & R(V \oplus W)
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			equals $\sigma_{VW}$. Moreover,
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					R(V) \wedge S^W \arrow[r, "- \wedge \iota \wedge -"] & R(V) \wedge R(0) \wedge S^W \arrow[rr, "{R(V) \wedge \sigma_{0,W}^{\op}}"] & & R(V) \wedge R(W) \arrow[r, "\mu_{VW}"] & R(V \oplus W)
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			equals $\sigma_{VW}^{\op}$.
		\end{itemize}
		An orthogonal ring spectrum is \textbf{\tb{commutative}} if also the following square commutes:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				R(V) \wedge R(W) \arrow[r, "\twist"] \arrow[d, "\mu_{VW}", swap] & R(W) \wedge R(V) \arrow[d, "\mu_{WV}"]
				\\ R(V \oplus W) \arrow[r, "R(\tau_{VW})", swap] & R(W \oplus V)
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
	\end{definition}

	\begin{remark} Some first remarks.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item Special case $V = 0$ or $W = 0$ of the unitality condition amount to \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright This is what I would have expected as the unitality condition}
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					R(W) \arrow[rrr, equal, bend right] \arrow[r, "\iota \wedge -"] & R(0) \wedge R(W) \arrow[r, "{\mu_{0, W}}"] & R(0 \oplus W) \arrow[r, "R(\proj_W)"] & R(W)
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			and the other way around.
			\item If the multiplication maps are commutative, then the two unitality conditions are equivalent. (Check!)
			{\scriptsize \medskip \\ Here's the checking. This amounts to the following commutative diagram:
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						R(V) \wedge S^W \arrow[r, "- \wedge \iota \wedge -"] \arrow[d] & R(V) \wedge R(0) \wedge S^W \arrow[rr, "{R(V) \wedge \sigma_{0,W}^{\op}}"] \arrow[d] & & R(V) \wedge R(W) \arrow[r, "\mu_{VW}"] \arrow[d] & R(V \oplus W) \arrow[d]
						\\ S^W \wedge R(V) \arrow[r, "- \wedge \iota \wedge -", swap] & S^W \wedge R(0) \wedge R(V) \arrow[rr, "{\sigma_{W,0} \wedge R(W)}", swap] & & R(W) \wedge R(V) \arrow[r, "\mu_{WV}", swap] & R(W \oplus V)
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				where the vertical maps are all the appropriate twist maps. The left square commutes by naturality of the twist, the middle squares commutes by a more careful inspection of the definition of $\sigma^{\op}$ and the right square commutes by commutativity of the multiplication map. Suppose the top row is $\sigma_{VW}^{\op}$ which is one of the unitality conditions. But the left-most vertical and the right-most vertical map are the flip maps corresponding to $\sigma_{VW}^{\op}$, so the bottom row must compose to $\sigma_{VW}$. This is the other unitality condition. The converse also holds by a dual argument.
			}
			\item The two maps \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{How should I think about these maps?}}
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					S^V \arrow[r, "- \wedge \iota"] & S^V \wedge R(0) \arrow[r, "{\sigma_{V,0}}"] & R(V \oplus 0) \cong R(V)
					\\ S^V \arrow[r, "\iota \wedge -", swap] & R(0) \wedge S^V \arrow[r, "{\sigma_{0,V}^{\op}}", swap] & R(0 \oplus V) \cong R(V)
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			are equal and we will denote them \marginpar{\tiny \tr{Check!}} $\tb{\iota_V} : S^V \to R(V)$, the \textbf{\tb{generalized unit maps}}.
			{\scriptsize \medskip \\They agree by the commutativity of the folllowing diagram:
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						S^V \arrow[d, equal] \arrow[r, "\iota \wedge -"] & R(0) \wedge S^V \arrow[r, "{\sigma_{0,V}^{\op}}"] \arrow[d] & R(0 \oplus V) \arrow[r, "\sim"] & R(V) \arrow[d, equal]
						\\ S^V \arrow[r, "- \wedge \iota", swap] & S^V \wedge R(0) \arrow[r, "{\sigma_{V,0}}", swap] & R(V \oplus 0) \arrow[r, "\sim", swap] & R(V)
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
			}
			\item Later:\footnote{Edit from the future: It turns out that we won't have time to cover this.} We'll introduce \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright This should basically mean that the unitality condition I expected is actually enough.} the smash product of orthogonal spectra $\wedge : \Sp \times \Sp \to \Sp$ which exhibits a symmetric monoidal structure with unit object $\S$. We'll see 
			\[\Ring(\Sp) \simeq \mathbf{Mon}(\Sp, \wedge, \S).\footnote{By the latter I mean the monoid objects in the symmetric monoidal category $\Sp$.} \]
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{remark}

	\begin{definition}
		A \textbf{\tb{morphism of orthogonal ring spectra}} $R \to S$ is a morphism of orthogonal spectra $f:R \to S$ such that
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				R(V) \wedge R(W) \arrow[r, "\mu_{VW}"] \arrow[d, "f_V \wedge f_W", swap] & R(V \oplus W) \arrow[d, "f_{V \oplus W}"]

			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
	\end{definition}

	\begin{definition}
		A \textbf{\tb{left module}} over an orthogonal ring spectrum $R$ is an orthogonal spectrum $M$ equipped with an \textbf{\tb{action map}} 
		\[ \alpha_{VW}: R(V) \wedge M(W) \to M(V \oplus W) \]
		that is $(O(V) \times O(W))$-equivariant satisfying the following properties.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Associativity: The following diagram commutes:

				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			\item Unitality: The composite \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{Oh no, this uses the generalized unit maps? I feel like I need to develop some more intuition on how to think about the structure maps... They are the higher algebra version of what?}}
			\begin{center}

				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			equals $\sigma_{VW}$.
		\end{itemize}
		A \textbf{\tb{morphism of left $R$-modules}} is a morphism of orthogonal spectra $f:M \to N$ such that the following commutes:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				R(V) \wedge M(W) \arrow[d, "R(V) \wedge f_W", swap] \arrow[r, "\alpha_{VW}"] & M(V \oplus W) \arrow[d, "f_{V \oplus W}"]

			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
	\end{definition}
	
	\begin{remark}
		The category of $R$-modules objects in $\Sp$ has limits and colimits and they are created on the underlying orthogonal spectra: Let $F: I \to {}_R\Mod(\Sp)$ be any functor, and let $M \in \Sp$ be a colimit of the composite

			\begin{tikzcd}
				I \arrow[r, "F"] & {}_R\Mod(\Sp) \arrow[r, "U"] & \Sp

	\subsection{Multiplication on homotopy groups}
	\marginpar{\footnotesize{\textsc{Lecture 8} \\ 09.05.2022}}
	Let $M$ be a left module over the ring spectrum $R$. We define a pairing
	\[ \tb{\cdot}: \pi_k(R) \times \pi_{\ell}(M) \to \pi_{k+\ell}(M) \]
	for $k,\ell \in \Z$.
	\medskip \\Let $f:S^{m+k} \to R_m, \ g:S^{n+\ell} \to M_n$ represent homotopy classes. We write $\tb{f \cdot g}$ for the composite
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			S^{m+k+n+\ell} \arrow[r, "f \wedge g"] & R_m \wedge M_n \arrow[r, "\alpha_{m,n}"] & M_{m+n}.
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	Then, we set \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright The $(-1)^{kn}$ morally switches $m+k+n+\ell$ around so that $m$ is next to $n$.}
	\[ \tb{[f] \cdot [g]} = (-1)^{kn} [f \cdot g]. \]
	
	\begin{theorem} \label{theorem: ring structure of stable homotopy groups}
		Let $R$ be an orthogonal ring spectrum and $M$ a left $R$-module.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item The pairing $\cdot$ is well-defined and biadditive.
			\item Let $\tb{1} \in \pi_0(R)$ denote the class of the unit $\iota:S^0 \to R_0$, i.e.\footnote{There is some slight abuse of notation.} the map with $0 \mapsto \iota, \ \infty \mapsto *$. Then, $1 \cdot x = x$ for all $x \in \pi_{\ell}(M)$.
			\item For all $x \in \pi_i(R), \ y \in \pi_k(R)$ and $z \in \pi_m(M)$ we have $(x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z)$.\footnote{Note that $R$ is a left $R$-module.}
			\item For $M = R$ the pairing $\cdot$ makes $\tb{\pi_*(R)} = \{\pi_k(R) \}_{k \in \Z}$ into a graded ring. If $R$ is commutative, then the graded multiplication satisfies $x \cdot y = (-1)^{k \cdot \ell} y \cdot x$ with $x \in \pi_k(R), \ y \in \pi_{\ell}(R)$.
			\item The pairings $\cdot$ make $\tb{\pi_*(M)} = \{\pi_k(M) \}_{k \in \Z}$ into a graded left module over $\pi_*(R)$.
			\item For every homomorphism $\psi:M \to N$ of left modules, the map $\psi_* : \pi_k(M) \to \pi_k(N)$ for $k \in \Z$ form a homomorphism of graded $\pi_*(R)$-modules. In other words, we have enhanced $\pi_*$ to a functor \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright This is actually kinda weird. For $R = \S$ we obtain $\pi_* : \Sp \to {}_{\pi_*(\S)} \GrMod$ but the category of the right is quite complicated since $\pi_*(\S)$ is complicated.}
			\[ \pi_* : {}_R\Mod(\Sp) \to {}_{\pi_*(R)} \GrMod. \]
			\item The suspension and loop isomorphisms
			\[ - \wedge S^1 : \pi_k(M) \to \pi_{k+1}(M \wedge S^1) \quad \text{and} \quad \alpha : \pi_k(\Omega M) \to \pi_{k+1}(M) \]
			are $\pi_*(R)$-linear.
			\item For every morphism $f:M \to N$ of left $R$-modules the connecting homomorphisms
			\[ \delta : \pi_{k+1}(Cf) \to \pi_k(M) \quad \text{and} \quad \delta : \pi_{k+1}(N) \to \pi_k(Ff) \]
			are $\pi_*(R)$-linear.
			\medskip \\So the LES's involving $\pi_*(Cf)$ and $\pi_*(Ff)$ are exact sequences of graded $\pi_*(R)$-modules.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{theorem}

	\begin{proof}
		Those diagrams killed me during the lecture.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item We start with well-definedness in $x = [f] \in \pi_k(R)$. The following diagram commutes:
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					S^1 \wedge R_m \wedge M_n \arrow[dd, "\sigma_m \wedge M_n", swap, bend right = 100] \arrow[d, "\iota_1 \wedge R_m \wedge M_n"] \arrow[r, "{S^1 \wedge \alpha_{m,n}}"] & S^1 \wedge M_{m+n} \arrow[dd, bend left = 100, "\sigma_{m+n}"] \arrow[d, "\iota_1 \wedge M_{m+n}"]
					\\ R_1 \wedge R_m \wedge M_n \arrow[d, "{\mu_{1,m} \wedge M_n}"] \arrow[r, "{R_1 \wedge \alpha_{m,n}}"] & R_1 \wedge M_{m+n} \arrow[d, "{\alpha_{1,m+n}}"]
					\\ R_{1+m} \wedge M_n \arrow[r, "{\alpha_{1+m,n}}", swap] & M_{1+m+n}
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			The upper square commutes on the nose by construction. The lower square is by compatibility of $R$ with $M$. The left part commutes by unitality in $R$. The right part commutes by unitality in $M$.
			\medskip \\If we replace $f:S^{m+k} \to R_m$ by its stabilization $\sigma_m \circ (S^1 \wedge f) : S^{1+m+k} \to R_{1+m}$ we get
			\begin{align*}
				(\sigma_m \circ (S^1 \wedge f)) \cdot g &= \alpha_{1+m,n} \circ ((\sigma_m \circ (S^1 \wedge f)) \wedge g)
				\\ &= \alpha_{1+m,n} \circ (\sigma_m \wedge M_n) \circ (S^1 \wedge f \wedge g)
				\\ &= \sigma_{m+n} \circ (S^1 \wedge (\alpha_{m,n} \circ (f \wedge g)))
				\\ &= \sigma_{m+n}(S^1 \wedge (f \cdot g))
			\end{align*}
			The third equality is by the above diagram. In the homotopy group this also yields $[f \cdot g]$, so it depends only on $[f]$ and not on the representative.
			\medskip \\Well-definedness in $[g] \in \pi_\ell(M)$ now. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright I wonder if such huge diagrams are pedagogically the correct thing to do.}
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					S^1 \wedge R_m \wedge M_n \arrow[rr, "\sigma_m \wedge M_n"] \arrow[dd, "\tau \wedge M_n", swap] & & R_{1+m} \wedge M_n \arrow[d, "{R(\chi_{1,m}) \wedge M_n}"] \arrow[r, "{\alpha_{1+m,n}}"] & M_{1+m+n} \arrow[dd, "{M(\chi_{1,m} \oplus \R^n)}"]
					\\ & & R_{m+1} \wedge M_n \arrow[dr, "{\alpha_{m+1,n}}"]
					\\ R_{m} \wedge S^1 \wedge M_n \arrow[rrd, "R_m \wedge \sigma_n", swap, bend right] \arrow[rru, bend left, "\sigma_m^{\op}"] \arrow[r, "R_m \wedge \iota_1 \wedge M_n", swap] & R_m \wedge R_1 \wedge M_n \arrow[ur, "{\mu_{m,1} \wedge M_n}"] \arrow[dr, "{R_m \wedge \alpha_{1,m}}", swap] & & M_{m+1+n}
					\\ & & R_m \wedge M_{1+n} \arrow[ur, "{\alpha_{m,1+n}}", swap]
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			The 'quadrilateral' on the top left commutes by definition of $\sigma_m^{\op}$. The quadrilateral on the top right commutes by $(O(1+m) \times O(m))$-equivariance of $\alpha_{1+m,n}$. The quadrilateral on the bottom right is by compatibility of $R$ with $M$. The bended 'triangles' are by unitality in $R$.
			\medskip \\If we replace $g:S^{n+\ell} \to M_n$ by its stabilization $\sigma_n^M \circ (S^1 \wedge g) : S^{1+n+\ell} \to M_{1+n}$ we obtain
			\begin{align*}
				f \cdot (\sigma_n \circ (S^1 \wedge g)) &= \alpha_{m,1+n} \circ (f \wedge (\sigma_n \circ (S^1 \wedge g)))
				\\ &= \alpha_{m,1+n} \circ (R_m \wedge \sigma_n) \circ (f \wedge S^1 \wedge g)
				\\ &= M(\chi_{1,m} \oplus \R^n) \circ \alpha_{1+m,n} \circ (\sigma_m \wedge M_n) \circ (\tau_{R_m, S^1} \wedge M_n) \circ (f \wedge S^1 \wedge g)
				\\ &= M(\chi_{1,m} \oplus \R^n) \circ \alpha_{1+m,n} \circ (\sigma_m \wedge M_n) \circ (S^1 \wedge f \wedge g) \circ (\chi_{m+k,1} \wedge S^{n+\ell}).
			\end{align*}
			The third equality is the diagram and the fourth equality is naturality of the flip map.
			\medskip \\On homotopy classes
			\begin{align*}
				[f] \cdot [\sigma_m \circ (S^1 \wedge g)] &= (-1)^{k(1+n)} [f \cdot (\sigma_m \circ (S^1 \wedge g))]
				\\ &= (-1)^{k(1+n)} \cdot (-1)^m \cdot (-1)^{m+k} \cdot [(\sigma_m \circ (S^1 \wedge f)) \cdot g]
				\\ &= (-1)^{kn} [f \cdot g] 
				\\ &= [f] \cdot [g]
			\end{align*}
			using \textbf{\#1.1} and \textbf{\#2.1} in the second equality and independency of the choice of $f$ in the third equality.
			\medskip \\Schwede (after almost one hour): \emph{We have seven parts... and we've almost proved part 1!}
			\item For $g:S^{n+\ell} \to M_n$ the composite
			\[ S^{n+\ell} \cong S^0 \wedge S^{n+\ell} \xrightarrow{\iota_0 \wedge g} R_0 \wedge M_n \xrightarrow{\alpha_{0,n}} M_n \]
			is $g$. So $1 \cdot [g] = [\iota] \cdot [g] = [g]$.
			{\scriptsize \medskip \\Indeed, this is the diagram
				\begin{center}

				\end{center}
			where $\sigma_{0,n} = \id_{M_n}$ doesn't literally hold but up to this $S^0 \wedge - \cong \id_{\Top_*}$ identification. The right part is by unitality in $M$.

			\item Let $e:S^{p+j} \to R_p, \ f:S^{m+k} \to R_m, \ g:S^{n+\ell} \to M_n$ be representatives of classes in $\pi_j(R), \ \pi_k(R), \ \pi_{\ell}(M)$. Then, the following diagram commutes:

				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center} 
			\item Graded-commutativity: Let $f:S^{m+k} \to R_m$ and $g:S^{n+\ell} \to R_n$. The following commutes:
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					S^{m+k+n+\ell} \arrow[r, "f \wedge g"] \arrow[d, "{\chi_{m+k,n+\ell}}"] \arrow[rr, "f \cdot g", bend left] & R_m \wedge R_n \arrow[d, "\tau"] \arrow[r, "{\mu_{m,n}}"] & R_{m+n} \arrow[d, "{R(\chi_{m,n})}"]

				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			Here, the right square commutes by commutativity of $R$. So
			\begin{align*}
				[f] \cdot [g] &= (-1)^{kn} [f \cdot g]
				\\ &= (-1)^{kn} (-1)^{(m+k)(n+\ell)} (-1)^{mn} [g \cdot f]
				\\ &= (-1)^{m \ell + k \ell} [g \cdot f]
				\\ &= (-1)^{k \ell} [g] \cdot [f].
			\end{align*}
			\item By (iv) we know that $\pi_*(R)$ is a graded ring. In (i) -- (iii) we verified the module axioms.
			\item Let $\psi:M \to N$ be a homomorphism of left $R$-modules and let $f:S^{m+k} \to R_m$ and $g:S^{n+\ell} \to M_n$. Then,
			\begin{align*}
				f \cdot (\psi_n \circ g) &= \alpha_{m,n} \circ (f \wedge (\psi_n \circ g))
				\\ &= \alpha_{m,n} \circ (R_m \wedge \psi_n) \circ (f \wedge g)
				\\ &= \psi_{m+n} \circ \alpha_{m,n} \circ (f \wedge g)
				\\ &= \psi_{m+n} \circ (f \cdot g)
			\end{align*}
			where the third equality uses that $\psi$ is a homomorphism of $R$-modules. On homotopy classes
			\[ [f] \cdot \psi_*[g] = [f] \cdot [\psi_n \circ g] = (-1)^{kn} [f \cdot (\psi_n \circ g)] = (-1)^{kn} [\psi_{m+n}(f \cdot g)]
			= \psi_* ([f] \cdot [g]). \]
			\item Let $f:S^{m+k} \to R_m$ and $g:S^{n+\ell} \to M_n$. Then,
			\begin{align*}
				(f \cdot g) \wedge S^1 &= (\alpha_{m,n} \circ (f \wedge g)) \wedge S^1
				\\ &= (\alpha_{m,n}^M \wedge S^1) \circ (f \wedge g \wedge S^1)
				\\ &= \alpha_{m,n}^{M \wedge S^1} \circ (f \wedge (g \wedge S^1))
				\\ &= f \cdot (g \wedge S^1)
			\end{align*}
			Note $\alpha_{m,n}^{M \wedge S^1} = \alpha_{m,n}^M \wedge S^1$.
			\medskip \\On the level of homotopy classes, we get $([f] \cdot [g]) \wedge S^1 = [f] \cdot ([g] \wedge S^1)$.
			\medskip \\The map $\alpha$ factors as the composite \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Could also do a dual argument.}
			\[ \pi_k(\Omega M) \xrightarrow{- \wedge S^1} \pi_{k+1}((\Omega M) \wedge S^1) \xrightarrow{\eps_*} \pi_{k+1}(M) \]
			so we deduce the result for $\alpha$ using (vi). \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{Need to check that $\eps$ is a module homomorphism.}}
			\item The connecting homomorphism is defined as the composite
			\[ \pi_{k+1}(Cf) \xrightarrow{p_*} \pi_{k+1}(M \wedge S^1) \xrightarrow{- \wedge S^{-1}} \pi_k(M) \]
			with $p: Cf = (M \wedge [0,1]) \cup_f N \to M \wedge S^1$. By expanding all definitions\marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{Check that $p$ is $R$-linear.}}, $p$ is $R$-linear, so $p_*$ is $\pi_*(R)$-linear by (vi). On the other hand, we have seen in (vii) that $- \wedge S^{-1}$ is also $\pi_*(R)$-linear.

	\end{example}

	\begin{example}
		Let $M$ be a topological monoid (e.g. discrete) and $R$ be a ring spectrum. The \textbf{\tb{monoid ring spectrum $RM$}} is $R \wedge M_+$ with multiplication maps

		\noindent If $\iota$ is the unit map for $R$, then the unit maps for $RM$ are given by
		\[ S^V \to (RM)(V) = R(V) \wedge M_+, \ v \mapsto \iota_V(v) \wedge 1. \]
		Special case: Set $R = \S$, then $\S M$ is the \textbf{\tb{spherical monoid ring}}. Its underlying orthogonal spectrum is $\tb{\Sigma_+^{\infty}} M = \Sigma^{\infty}(M_+)$.

		\[ \iota_V : S^V \to (HA)(V) = A[S^V], \ v \mapsto 1 \cdot v. \]
		This gives a functor
		\[ H: {}_A \Mod \to {}_{HA} \Mod(\Sp) \]
		from $H: \Ring \to \Sp$. This is secretly how algebra is important in topology.

	\begin{example}
		The \textbf{\tb{opposite ring spectrum $R^{\op}$}} \marginpar{\footnotesize{\textsc{Lecture 9} \\ 11.05.2022}} of an orthogonal ring spectrum $R$ has the same underlying orthogonal spectrum and the same unit maps with a new multiplication $\tb{\mu^{\op}_{V,W}} : R^{\op}(V) \wedge R^{\op}(W) \to R^{\op}(V \oplus W)$ given by
		\[ R(V) \wedge R(W) \xrightarrow{\tau} R(W) \wedge R(V) \xrightarrow{\mu_{W,V}^R} R(W \oplus V) \xrightarrow{R(\tau_{W,V})} R(V \oplus W). \]

	\noindent The first constructions of algebraic $K$-theory are based on $\GL_n(k)$ which is one facet where the following example comes into.
	
	\begin{example}
		As is often the case, there is an abstract nonsense approach taking the endomorphism object of some object in a stable $\infty$-category enriched over $\Sp$. But this requires too much technology for now. Instead, let us remain down to earth.

		where $\tb{m_+} = \{0,1,\dots,m \}$ 
		with basepoint $0$. This might seem to not give every matrix: Elements seem like matrices in which every row has at most one non-zero element. But homotopically, \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Possibly, this merely refers to \textbf{\#5.4}.} a wedge really gives products.
		\medskip \\The multiplication maps $M_m(R)(V) \wedge M_m(R)(W) \to M_m(R)(V \oplus W)$ are given by \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{I guess the unit is $v \mapsto (k \mapsto \iota_V(v) \wedge k)$?}}

		\begin{exercise}[\textbf{\#5.4}]
			Let $R$ be a ring spectrum, then $\pi_*(M_m(R)) \cong M_m(\pi_*(R))$.
		\end{exercise} 
		\noindent Apparently, ideals and quotients from the classical setting do not generally transfer over to the spectrum setting.
	\end{example}

	\noindent We end with an example from geometric topology:

	\begin{example}[$\MO$ and $\MOP$]
		Recall (\textbf{\ref{example: Thom spectrum as orthogonal spectrum}}) that the Thom spectrum $MO$ was defined by
		\begin{align*}
			\MO(V) &= \Th \left(\text{tautological $\dim(V)$-plane bundle over } \Gr_{\dim{V}}(V^{\infty}) \right)
			\\ &\cong L(\R^k, V^{\infty})_+ \wedge_{O(k)} S^k
		\end{align*}
		with $k = \dim{V}$. This becomes a commutative orthogonal ring spectrum via the multiplication maps 
		\[ \MO(V) \wedge \MO(W) \to \MO(V \oplus W), \ (v,L) \wedge (w, L') \mapsto (\kappa_{V,W}(v,w), \kappa_{V,W}(L \oplus L')) \]
		where
		\[ \tb{\kappa_{V,W}} : V^{\infty} \oplus W^{\infty} \to (V \oplus W)^{\infty}, \ ((v_1, v_2, \cdots), (w_1, w_2, \cdots)) \mapsto ((v_1, w_1), (v_2, w_2), \cdots). \]
		The unit map is
		\[ S^V \to \MO(V), \ v \mapsto ((v,0,0,\cdots), V \oplus 0^{\infty}). \]
		There would be a bunch of stuff to check now but we'll have faith in Schwede. Hopefully later, we will show:
		\begin{quote}
			\textbf{Fact.} There is an isomorphism of graded rings $\pi_*(\MO) = \MO_* \cong \Omega_*$ where $\Omega_*$ is the ring of bordism classes of smooth closed manifolds.
		\end{quote}
		The \textbf{\tb{periodic Thom spectrum $\MOP$}} is \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Is this an ad hoc notation? I can't really find information about this on the www.} a $\Z$-graded commutative orthogonal ring spectrum defined as follows:
		\begin{align*}
			\MOP(V) &= \Th \left( \text{tautological vector bundle over } \tb{\Gr(V^{\infty})} = \coprod_{n \geq 0} \Gr_k(V^{\infty}) \right)
			\\ &= \bigvee_{k \geq 0} \Th \left(\text{tautological bundle over } \Gr_k(V^{\infty}) \right)
			\\ &= \bigvee_{k \geq 0} L(\R^k, V^{\infty})_+ \wedge_{O(k)} S^k.
		\end{align*}
		The multiplication and unit maps make just as much sense for $\MOP$ as for $\MO$.
		\medskip \\The spectrum $\MOP$ is $\Z$-graded as follows: A subspectrum $\tb{\MOP^{[m]}} \subseteq \MOP$ is defined by
		\[ \MOP^{[m]}(V) = L(\R^{\dim(V) + m}, V^{\infty})_+ \wedge_{O(\dim(V) + m)} S^{\dim(V)+m}. \]
		In particular, $\MO = \MOP^{[0]}$. Then, $\MOP \cong \bigvee_{m \in \Z} \MOP^{[m]}$. The multiplication is graded, i.e.
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				\MOP^{[m]}(V) \wedge \MOP^{[n]}(W) \arrow[r, hookrightarrow] \arrow[d] & \MOP(V) \wedge \MOP(W) \arrow[d, "{\mu_{V,W}}"]
				\\ \MOP^{[m+n]}(V \oplus W) \arrow[r, hookrightarrow] & \MOP(V \oplus W)
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		We \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright The inclusion of homotopy groups is by \textbf{\ref{prop: direct sums, products, wedges of spectra}}.} define $\tb{t} \in \pi_{-1} \left(\MOP^{[-1]} \right) \subseteq \pi_{-1}(\MOP)$ as the class represented by 
		\[ \{0, \infty \} = S^0 \to \MOP^{[-1]}(\R) = \left(\MOP^{[-1]} \right)_1, \ 0 \mapsto (0, \{0 \}). \]
		We define $\tb{\sigma} \in \pi_1 \left(\MOP^{[1]} \right) \subseteq \pi_1(\MOP)$ represented by
		\[ S^2 \to \MOP^{[1]}(\R) = \left(\MOP^{[1]} \right)_1, \ x \mapsto \left((x,0,0,\cdots), \R^2 \oplus 0^{\infty} \right). \]
	\end{example}

	\begin{theorem}
		Let $t, \sigma$ be defined as above.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item In $\pi_0(\MO) \subseteq \pi_0(\MOP)$ we have $t \cdot \sigma = 1$.
			\item The relation $2 = 0$ holds in $\pi_*(\MO)$ and $\pi_*(\MOP)$ and all these groups are $\F_2$-vector spaces.
			\item Let $m \in \Z$.
			\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
				\item For $m \geq 0$, the spectrum $\MOP^{[m]}$ is stably equivalent to $\MO \wedge S^m$.
				\item For $m \leq 0$, the spectrum $\MOP^{[m]}$ is stably equivalent to $\Omega^{-m}(\MO)$.
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{theorem}

	\begin{proof}
		Let's prove this.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item The class $t \cdot \sigma$ is represented by the composite
			\[ S^2 = S^{0+2} \to \MOP(\R) \wedge \MOP(\R) \xrightarrow{\mu_{1,1}} \MOP(\R^2) = \Th(\Gr((\R \oplus \R)^{\infty})) \]
			given by
			\[ (x_1, x_2) = x \mapsto (0, \{0 \}) \wedge (x, \R^2) \mapsto (((0, x_1), (0,x_2), (0,0), \cdots), \kappa_{\R, \R}(0^\infty \oplus (\R^2 \oplus 0^{\infty})). \]
			The unit is represented by the map 
			\[ \iota_2 : S^2 \to \MOP(\R^2), \ (x_1, x_2) \mapsto (((x_1, x_2), (0,0), (0,0, \cdots)), \R^2 \oplus 0^{\infty}). \]
			Choose a path $\omega : [0,1] \to L(\R^2, (\R^2)^{\infty})$ between the two linear isometric embeddings.
			{\scriptsize \medskip \\This path exists because the image essentially lives in $\R^4$ where the two maps essentially differ by the isometry
				\[ (a,b,c,d) \mapsto (c, a, d, b) \]
			which is a linear map with determinant $1$. Hence, it lives in the same path component as $\id_{\R^4} \in O_4(\R)$. \medskip \\
			} 
			This induces a homotopy between the representatives for $t \cdot \sigma$ and $\iota_2$ by
			\[ f_t : S^2 \to \MOP(\R^2), \ x \mapsto (\omega_t(x), \omega_t(\R^2 \oplus 0^{\infty})). \]
			So $t \cdot \sigma = 1$ in $\pi_0(\MOP)$.
			\item Let $R$ be any commutative ring spectrum \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright So we are doing this formal argument in this formal setting.} and $t \in \pi_k(R)$ be invertible with $k$ odd. Such $t$ exists by (i). Then,
			\[ t^2 = (-1)^{k \cdot k} t^2 = -t^2 \implies 2t^2 = 0 \implies 2 = 0 \]
			by graded-commutativity.
			\item Since $t \in \pi_{-1} \left(\MOP^{[-1]} \right)$ is invertible, the map
			\[ t \cdot - : \pi_{k+1} \left(\MOP^{[m+1]} \right) \to \pi_k \left( \MOP^{[m]} \right) \]
			is bijective. We now show that this map is realized by a stable equivalence of orthogonal spectra. Consider the following map:
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\MOP \arrow[r, "j"] & \sh(\MOP) 
					\\ \MOP^{[m+1]} \arrow[u, hookrightarrow] \arrow[r] & \sh(\MOP^{[m]}) \arrow[u, hookrightarrow]
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			The value of $j$ at $V$ is
			\begin{align*}
				j_V : \MOP(V) &\to (\sh{\MOP})(V) = \MOP(V \oplus \R)
				\\ (v, L) &\mapsto (i_V^{\infty}(v), i_V^{\infty}(L)) 
			\end{align*}
			where $\iota_V : V \to V \oplus \R, \ v \mapsto (v,0)$.
			\medskip \\By direct inspection the map
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\MOP(V) \arrow[r, "{- \wedge (0, \{0 \})}"] & \MOP(V) \wedge \MOP(\R) \arrow[r, "{\mu_{V, \R}}"] & \MOP(V \oplus \R) 
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			equals $j_V$. Thus,
			\[ j_* = (t \cdot -) : \pi_{k+1} \left( \MOP^{[m+1]} \right) \to \pi_{k+1} \left(\sh{\MOP^{[m]}} \right) = \pi_k \left(\MOP^{[m]} \right), \]
			so $j$ is a stable equivalence because $t \cdot -$ is bijective. Get
			\[ \MOP^{[m+1]} \xrightarrow{j} \sh{\MOP^{[m]}} \xleftarrow{\lambda_{\MOP^{[m]}}} \MOP^{[m]} \wedge S^1 \]
			which is a zig-zag of stable equivalences (\textbf{\ref{theorem: lambda are stable equivalences}}). The $m$-fold application of this yields the stable equivalence $\MOP^{[m]} \approx \MO \wedge S^m$.
			\medskip \\For $m \leq 0$ we have $\MO = \MOP^{[0]} \approx \MOP^{[-m]} \wedge S^{-m}$, so
			\[ \Omega^{-m}(\MO) \approx \Omega^{-m} \left(\MOP^{[-m]} \wedge S^{-m} \right) \approx \MOP^{[-m]}. \]
			because $\Omega$ preserves stable equivalences (\textbf{\ref{corollary: stable equivalence}}) and because $\Omega$ and $\Sigma$ shift homotopy groups in opposite directions (\textbf{\ref{theorem: loop, suspension}}).
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proof}

	\section{The stable homotopy category and the derived category of $R$}
	Schwede has given a version of this course two times already in Bonn and in each iteration there are slight changes. The last time he realized that most arguments he has done basically work in a greater generality than in the stable homotopy category. Indeed, they are all results in the derived category of a ring spectrum and so this is the approach we are following in this year.
	\subsection{Cofibration categories}
	
	Here is the fabled derived category of a ring spectrum.
	
	\begin{definition}
		The \textbf{\tb{derived category $D(R)$}} of an orthogonal ring spectrum $R$ is the localization ${}_R \Mod[(\text{stable equivalence})^{-1}]$.
	\end{definition}
	\noindent This exists! In one way or another... We will probably sweep the set-theoretic formalism under the rug but one of the usual ways to deal with this is to mumble something about Grothendieck universes.
	
	\begin{definition}
		The \textbf{\tb{stable homotopy category}} is 
		\[ \tb{\SH} = D(\S) = \Sp[(\text{stable equivalences})^{-1}]. \]
	\end{definition}

	\noindent We are following this approach: \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright The homotopy category of a stable $\infty$-category is a triangulated category.}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Ring \arrow[r, "H"] \arrow[rddd, bend right, "A \mapsto D(A) \simeq D(HA)", swap] & \Ring(\Sp) \arrow[d, "R \mapsto {}_R \Mod"] \
			\\ & (\text{stable cofibration categories}) \arrow[d, dotted] \arrow[dd, bend left = 90]
			\\ & (\text{stable $\infty$-categories}) \arrow[d, dotted]
			\\ & (\text{triangulated categories})
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	Here, $\Ring(\Sp) \to (\text{triangulated categories}), \ R \mapsto D(R)$. We are skipping the stable $\infty$-category part but should be keeping in mind that naturally this is in between. Instead of model categories, we take the shortcut of cofibration categories which requires less theory that needs to be developed and allows us to save a few lectures.\footnote{Though (quote) it will also depend on how often Schwede says that he doesn't want to check something and lets us do it.} It is probably not possible to not include any of such theory, though.
	\begin{definition}[Ken Brown\footnote{He defined fibration categories. At this point, model categories already existed.}]
		A \textbf{\tb{cofibration category}} is a category $\Ccat$ equipped with two classes of morphisms, the \textbf{\tb{cofibrations $\Cof$}} and the \textbf{\tb{weak equivalences $W$}} that satisfy:
		\begin{enumerate}[(C1)]
			\item All isomorphisms are cofibrations and weak equivalences, cofibrations are stable under composition, $\Ccat$ has an initial object $\emptyset$, all $\emptyset \to X$ are cofibrations.
			\item If $f,g$ are composable morphisms and two of $f,g$ and $gf$ are weak equivalences, then so is the third.
			\item If $i:A \to B$ is a cofibration, then all pushouts
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					A \arrow[r, "f"] \arrow[d, "i", swap, tail] & C \arrow[d, dashed, "j"]
					\\ B \arrow[r] & D
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			exist in $\Ccat$ and $j$ is a cofibration. If $i$ is in addition a weak equivalence, then so is $j$.
			\item Every $\Ccat$-morphism has a factorization as a cofibration followed by a weak equivalence.
		\end{enumerate}
		An \marginpar{\footnotesize{\textsc{Lecture 10} \\ 16.05.2022}} \textbf{\tb{acyclic/trivial cofibration}} is a morphism that is a cofibration and a weak equivalence. We denote cofibrations by $\tb{\rightarrowtail}$ and weak equivalences by $\tb{\xrightarrow{\approx}}$.\footnote{Schwede denotes weak equivalences by $\xrightarrow{\sim}$ which I dislike since I often use this for isomorphisms. It will unfortunately be a little confusing following the lecture with conflicting notations (especially because Schwede will later use $\xrightarrow{\approx}$ for something else) but I will stick to my preference. I've got this notation from Aaron Mazel-Gee's notes on homological algebra.}

	\noindent The \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{What's a typical cofibration category that does not come from a model category?}} restriction of a model category to the full subcategory generated by its cofibrant objects $\Ccat_c$ yields a cofibration category.
	
	\begin{remark}[Immediate consequences]
		Mhm. \label{remark: immediate consequences of cofibration category}
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item Finite coproducts exist in $\Ccat$.
			\item The two canonical morphisms $A \to A \amalg B \leftarrow B$ are cofibrations.
			\item The coproduct of two cofibrations $i:A \to B$ and $i':A' \to B'$ is a cofibration.
			\item The coproduct of two acyclic cofibrations is an acyclic cofibration.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{remark}

	\begin{proof}
		Mhm.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item Use (C3) with $A = \emptyset$ and the fact that all maps from the initial object are cofibrations (C1).
			\item Use (C3) with (C1).
			\item Apply (C3) twice:
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					A \arrow[r, rightarrowtail, "i"] \arrow[d] & B \arrow[d] & A' \arrow[d] \arrow[r, rightarrowtail, "i'"] & B' \arrow[d]
					\\ A \amalg A' \arrow[r, "i \amalg A'", swap, dashed] & B \amalg A' & B \amalg A' \arrow[r, "B \amalg i'", swap, dashed] & B \amalg B'
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			By assumption, $i,i'$ are cofibrations. We have constructed pushout squares, so also the dashed arrows are cofibrations by (C3). Thus, the composition
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					A \amalg A' \arrow[rr, "i \amalg i'", dashed] \arrow[dr, "i \amalg A'", swap, rightarrowtail] & & B \amalg B'
					\\ & B \amalg A' \arrow[ur, "B \amalg i", swap, rightarrowtail]
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			is a cofibration by (C1).
			\item In (iii) replace the word 'cofibration' by 'acyclic cofibration' everywhere.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proof}
	\noindent The \textbf{\tb{homotopy category}} of a cofibration category is a localization $\gamma : \Ccat \to \Ho(\Ccat) = \Ccat[W^{-1}]$ at the class $W$.
	\medskip \\Note that this only depends on $W$, so in practice sometimes there are several classes of cofibrations $\Cof$ compatible with $W$ which can be useful.
	
	\begin{definition} \label{def: h-cofibration of spectra}
		A morphism $f:A \to B$ of orthogonal spectra is an \textbf{\tb{$h$-cofibration}} if it has the \textbf{\tb{HEP}}: For every morphism of orthogonal spectra $\phi : B \to X$ and every homotopy $H:A \wedge [0,1]_+ \to X$ starting with $\phi \circ f : A \to X$ there is a homotopy $\ol{H}: B \wedge [0,1]_+ \to X$ that extends $H$ and begins with $\phi$, i.e. 
		\[ \ol{H} \circ (f \wedge [0,1]_+) = H, \quad \ol{H}(- \wedge 0) = \phi. \]
	\end{definition}

	\noindent There is a universal test case:
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			A \arrow[r, "f"] \arrow[d, "- \wedge 0", swap] & B \arrow[d] \arrow[rrddd, "\phi", bend left]
			\\ {A \wedge [0,1]_+} \arrow[rrrdd, bend right] \arrow[r] & {(A \wedge [0,1]_+) \cup_f B = \tb{M_f}} \arrow[dr]
			\\ & & {B \wedge [0,1]_+} \arrow[dr, dashed, "\ol{H}"]
			\\ & & & X
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	If $f$ is an $h$-cofibration, then $X = (A \wedge [0,1]_+) \cup_f B$ shows that the canonical morphism
	\[ (A \wedge [0,1]_+) \cup_f B \to B \wedge [0,1]_+ \]
	has a retraction. (In $\CGWH$ this implies that it is also a closed embedding.)
	{\scriptsize \medskip \\Schwede said a lot of words in the lecture which I didn't catch because (as so often) I was transcribing the diagram. I believe he wanted to do an argument of the following sort: The HEP amounts to the existence of a dashed arrow in the following diagram
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				A \arrow[r, "f"] \arrow[d, "- \wedge 0", swap] & B \arrow[d, "- \wedge 0"] \arrow[ddr, bend left, "\phi"]
				\\ {A \wedge [0,1]_+} \arrow[r, "{f \wedge [0,1]_+}", swap] \arrow[rrd, "H", swap, bend right] & {B \wedge [0,1]_+} \arrow[dr, dashed, "\ol{H}"]
				\\ & & X
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
	where really every condition in the HEP is contained in the commutativity of this diagram. (See also \textbf{Modern Classical Homotopy Theory, 5.7}.) On the other hand, $M_f$ is the pushout of the cocone $A \wedge [0,1]_+ \leftarrow A \to B$, so the above square factors through $M_f$. But if $f$ is an $h$-cofibration, then by the above, there is a map $\ol{H}$ and the universal property of the pushout shows that the composition $M_f \to B \wedge [0,1]_+ \to X$ is $\id$ because $\id$ would also have fitted into the diagram. This shows that we get a retraction.\medskip \\}
	There is an adjoint form of the HEP: \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright This is an explicit computational check. See also \textbf{Modern Classical Homotopy Theory, 5.1}.} Given HE data $(\phi, H)$ adjoint to the commutative square
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			A \arrow[r, "\tilde{H}"] \arrow[d, "f", swap] & {X^{[0,1]}} \arrow[d, "\ev_0"]
			\\ B \arrow[ur, "\tilde{\ol{H}}", dashed] \arrow[r, "\phi", swap] & X
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	In other words, the $h$-cofibrations are precisely the class of morphisms that have the left lifting property against all evaluations $\ev_0:X^{[0,1]} \to X$ for all $X \in \Sp$.
	
	\begin{fact} \label{fact: LLP closure properties}
		Let $\EE$ be a class of morphisms in a category $\Ccat$ and let $\tb{{}^{\perp} \EE}$ be the class of morphisms with the LLP against all morphisms in $\EE$. Then, ${}^{\perp} \EE$ is closed under cobase change, sequential composite, composition and retract.
	\end{fact}

	\begin{proof}
		See \textbf{\#6.1}. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Or e.g. books on model categories or $\infty$-categories. (Hovey and Land both contain this iirc.)}
	\end{proof}
	\noindent In particular, the $h$-cofibrations of orthogonal spectra have all these closure properties.
	
	\begin{theorem} \label{theorem: cofibration structure on R-Mod}
		The following define a cofibration structure on ${}_R \Mod$ for $R \in \Sp$:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Weak equivalences = stable equivalences of underlying orthogonal spectra
			\item Cofibrations = $h$-cofibrations of underlying orthogonal spectra
		\end{itemize}
	\end{theorem}

	\begin{proof}
		Let's go through the axioms.
		\begin{enumerate}[(C1)]
			\item All isomorphisms are cofibrations and stable equivalences. The cofibrations are stable under composition (\textbf{\ref{fact: LLP closure properties}}). There is an initial object. The morphism $* \to X$ is always an $h$-cofibration.
			{\scriptsize \medskip \\I guess this amounts to
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						* \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & {Y^{[0,1]}} \arrow[d, "\ev_0"]
						\\ X \arrow[r, "\phi", swap] \arrow[ur, dashed] & Y
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				for every space $Y$. But the upper triangle is no requirement because $*$ is initial. The lower triangle corresponds (by adjunction again) to a homotopy $X \wedge [0,1]_+ \to Y$ starting in $\phi$ but the map $x \wedge t \mapsto \phi(x)$ should do the job.
			}
			\item 2-out-of-3: OK.
			\item Stable \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Note that this innocent part was actually quite some work!} under cobase change (\textbf{\ref{fact: LLP closure properties}}). Acyclic cofibrations are stable under cobase change (\textbf{\ref{prop: preservations of stable equivalences}}(v)).
			\item Let $f:X \to Y$ be a morphism of $R$-modules. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright This would take quite a lot of work for model categories and rely on the small object argument.} We factor it through the mapping cylinder 
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					& X \arrow[r, "f"] \arrow[d, "- \wedge 1", swap] & Y \arrow[d]
					\\ & {X \wedge [0,1]_+} \arrow[r] & {(X \wedge [0,1]_+) \cup_f Y} \arrow[dr]
					\\ X \arrow[ur, "- \wedge 0", bend left] \arrow[urr, "i"] \arrow[rrr, "f", swap] & & & Y \arrow[uul, equal, bend right]
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			Note \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright This diagram is so messy but I guess he just wants this map...} that $(f \circ \proj) \cup \id: (X \wedge [0,1]_+) \cup_f Y \to Y$ is a homotopy equivalence and thus a stable equivalence.
			\medskip \\Now, we have
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					& X \vee X \arrow[r, rightarrowtail] \arrow[d, "X \vee f", swap] & {X \wedge [0,1]_+} \arrow[d]
					\\ X \arrow[r, rightarrowtail] & X \vee Y \arrow[r, rightarrowtail] & {(X \wedge [0,1]_+) \cup_f Y}
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			where $X \vee X \cong X \wedge \{0,1 \}_+$. Here, $X \to X \vee Y$ is a cofibration with the same argument as in \textbf{\ref{remark: immediate consequences of cofibration category}} using \textbf{\ref{fact: LLP closure properties}}. Moreover, the top arrow is a cofibration \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Here, $\{0,1 \} = S^0 \to D^1 = [0,1]$ is an $h$-cofibration as a CW pair. Hence, it remains such after applying $(-)_+$ (since the respective retract is preserved). Now $X \wedge -$ preserves $h$-cofibrations, so altogether the top row is a cofibration.}, so also its cobase change is one (\textbf{\ref{fact: LLP closure properties}}). Hence, the lower composition is a cofibration (\textbf{\ref{fact: LLP closure properties}}) and so we have found a factorization.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proof}

	\noindent This was a first instance where it was quite feasible to check that a given structure indeed defines a cofibration category. There are many more examples in \textbf{\#6.2}. Constrastingly, it is rarely easy to check that a given structure defines a model category, so this is a nice advantage of cofibration categories.

	\begin{remark}
		The stable equivalences of $R$-modules can be complemented by various different classes of cofibrations into a cofibration category. For example:
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item HEP internal to ${}_R \Mod$.
			\item Cofibrations in some model category structure (e.g. projective model structure).
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{remark}

	\begin{proposition}[Gluing Lemma] \label{prop: gluing lemma}
		Let $\Ccat$ be a cofibration category and consider \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Seems like this will appear in HoCAS anyway. (But only for $\sSet$ and $\Top$.)}
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				A \arrow[d, "\approx"] & B \arrow[l, rightarrowtail, "i", swap] \arrow[r, "f"] \arrow[d, "\approx"] & C \arrow[d, "\approx"]
				\\ A' & B' \arrow[l, rightarrowtail, "i'"] \arrow[r, "f'", swap] & C'
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		such that $i$ and $i'$ are cofibrations and all these vertical \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Note that these pushouts exist by (C3).} morphisms are weak equivalences. Then, the induced morphism 
		\[ A \cup_B C \to A' \cup_{B'} C' \]
		is a weak equivalence.
	\end{proposition}

	\begin{proof}
		Proof by intimidating the students that we will already be proving more than people want to see. (This proof is not completely straightforward though and would require hints if given as an exercise.)
	\end{proof}

	\noindent Here is an important special case that at first sight seems similar to (C3) but in reality does say something different:
	\begin{quote}
		\textbf{Claim} (Pushout along cofibration preserves weak equivalences)\textbf{.} Consider a pushout square \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Note again the homotopy pushout viewpoint: This is already a homotopy pushout since $B \to A$ is a cofibration, so it preserves weak equivalences.}
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				B \arrow[r, rightarrowtail] \arrow[d, "{f, \approx}", swap] & A \arrow[d]
				\\ C \arrow[r] & A \cup_B C
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		then $A \to A \cup_B C$ is a weak equivalence.
		
		\begin{proof}
			Apply the Gluing Lemma (\textbf{\ref{prop: gluing lemma}}) to
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					A \arrow[d, equal] & B \arrow[l, rightarrowtail, "i", swap] \arrow[d, equal] \arrow[r, equal] & B \arrow[d, "f"]
					\\ A & \arrow[l, rightarrowtail, "i"]  B \arrow[r, "f", swap] & C
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			where $f$ is a weak equivalence.
		\end{proof}
	\end{quote}

	\noindent We will actually use this quite often!
	
	\subsection{The homotopy relation}
	
	One motivation for cofibration categories or model categories is that they give the correct setting of exercising homotopy theory. So surely there should actually be some general notion of a homotopy! To speak about homotopies in the explicit setting of spaces, we always consider a cylinder of a space, e.g. $X \times [0,1]$ or $X \wedge [0,1]_+$. So categorifying this notion is a natural first step.
	
	\begin{definition}
		Let $\Ccat$ be a cofibration category. A \textbf{\tb{cylinder object}} for an object $A$ is a quadruple $(I, i_0, i_1, p)$ where $I$ is a $\Ccat$-object and where the diagram \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright I really dislike this notation and prefer e.g. $\cyl(A)$.}
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				A \arrow[dr, "i_0", swap] \arrow[rrd, bend left, equal]
				\\ & I \arrow[r, "p"] & A
				\\ A \arrow[ur, "i_1"] \arrow[rru, equal, bend right]
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		commutes. Moreover, \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Note $i_0, i_1 \in W$ by 2-out-of-3.} we demand $p \in W$ and $(i_0 + i_1 : A \amalg A \to I) \in \Cof$. 
		{\scriptsize \medskip \\Pictorially, \begin{tikzcd}
				A \amalg A \arrow[r, "i_0 + i_1", rightarrowtail] \arrow[rr, bend right, "\nabla", swap] & I \arrow[r, "\approx"] & A.
			\end{tikzcd}\medskip \\}
		\noindent Two morphisms $f,g:A \to Z$ are \textbf{\tb{homotopic}} if there is a cylinder object $(I, i_0, i_1, p)$ for $A$ and a morphism $H:I \to Z$ called \textbf{\tb{homotopy}} if it satisfies
		\[ H \circ i_0 = f \quad \text{and} \quad H \circ i_1 = g. \]
	\end{definition}

	\noindent Note: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The localization functor $\gamma: \Ccat \to \Ho(\Ccat)$ takes the same value on homotopic morphisms:  Since $p:I \to A$ is a weak equivalence, \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright If I were to derive this, I would probably work the other way around.} $\gamma(p)$ is an isomorphism. Then,
		\[ \gamma(p) \circ \gamma(i_0) = \gamma(p \circ i_0) = \gamma(\id_A) = \gamma(p \circ i_1) = \gamma(p) \circ \gamma(i_1) \implies \gamma(i_0) = \gamma(i_1) \]
		since $\gamma(p)$ is an isomorphism. If $H:I \to A$ is a homotopy from $f$ to $g$, then
		\[ \gamma(f) = \gamma(H \circ i_0) = \gamma(H) \circ \gamma(i_0) = \gamma(H) \circ \gamma(i_1) = \gamma(H \circ i_1) = \gamma(g). \]
		\item Cylinder objects always exist: Use (C4) to factor
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				A \amalg A \arrow[rr, "\id + \id = \operatorname{fold}"] \arrow[dr, "i_0 + i_1", swap, rightarrowtail] & & A
				\\ & I \arrow[ur, "\approx", swap]
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\begin{example}
		In the cofibration structure of ${}_R \Mod$ from \textbf{\ref{theorem: cofibration structure on R-Mod}} the following is a cylinder object:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				{M \vee M = M \wedge \{0,1 \}_+} \arrow[rrr, "\operatorname{fold}", bend right, swap] \arrow[r, rightarrowtail] & {M \wedge [0,1]_+} \arrow[rr, "{p:[0,1) \mapsto *}"] & & M
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		Here, $p$ is a stable equivalence.
		\medskip \\So two morphisms in ${}_R \Mod$ that are homotopic in the classical sense (via $M \wedge [0,1]_+$) are also homotopic in the abstract sense. But not conversely! \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{What's an example?}}
	\end{example}

	\noindent While Schwede was preparing material for this course, there were several instances when he thought that he had found an easy argument which works in ${}_R \Mod$. Sadly, it would later always turn out that some general argument was used and so in the end the entire machinery was necessary. So eventually, Schwede had enough of it and decided not to try to be clever and to find his own arguments. In that respect, we are seeing the classical arguments from the classical literature.
	
	\begin{proposition} \label{prop: basic properties of homotopy}
		Let $A$ and $Z$ be objects in a cofibration category $\Ccat$.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item Homotopy is an equivalence relation on $\Ccat(A,Z)$.
			\item Postcomposition with any morphism $\phi:Z \to Z'$ preserves the homotopy relation. 
			\item Let \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright We even show that we can prechoose any cylinder object for $\ol{A}$.} $f,g : A \to Z$ be homotopic and let $\phi: \ol{A} \to A$ be any morphism. Then, there is an acyclic cofibration $s:Z \overset{\approx}{\rightarrowtail} Z'$ such that $s f\phi \simeq s g\phi$.
			\item Let \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Note that the other direction (c) doesn't need to hold.} $f,g:A \to Z$ be $\tau : \ol{A} \xrightarrow{\approx} A$ be a weak equivalence. If $f \tau \simeq g \tau$, then already $f \simeq g$.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proposition}

	\begin{proof}
		These are the classical arguments.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item We check all conditions of an equivalence relation.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Reflexivity: Let $(I, i_0, i_1, p)$ be any cylinder object for $A$ and let $f:A \to Z$. Put $H = f \circ p$. Then,
				\[ H i_0 = fpi_0 = f = fpi_1 = Hi_1. \]
				\item Symmetry: \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Recall that surprisingly there was no symmetry and transitivity in $\sSet$. What enables the properties here is that we can take different cylinder objects.} Let $H:I \to Z$ be a homotopy from $f$ to $g$ based on $(I, i_0, i_1, p)$. Note that $i_1 + i_0$ is also a cofibration because it differs from $i_0 + i_1$ by a swap isomorphism (C1).  Then, $H:I \to Z$ is a homotopy from $g$ to $f$ based on $(I, i_1, i_0, p)$.
				\item Transitivity: Let $(I, i_0, i_1, p)$ and $(J, j_0, j_1, q)$ be two cylinder objects for $A$.
				\begin{quote}
					\textbf{Claim.} We choose a pushout (C3) \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Heuristically, we glue together the homotopy intervals at the starting point and the endpoint.}
					\begin{center}
						\begin{tikzcd}
							A \arrow[d, "i_1", swap, rightarrowtail] \arrow[r, "j_0", rightarrowtail] & J \arrow[d, "b"]
							\\ I \arrow[r, "a", swap] & I \cup_A J
						\end{tikzcd}
					\end{center}
					and put $\ell_0 = a \circ i_0$ and $\ell_1 = b \circ j_1$. Moreover, there is a unique morphism $r:I \cup_A J \to A$ such that $ra = p$ and $rb = q$. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Note $pi_1 = \id_A = q j_0$.}
					\begin{center}
						\begin{tikzcd}
							A \arrow[d, "i_1", swap] \arrow[r, "j_0"] & J \arrow[d, "b"] \arrow[ddr, bend left, "q"]
							\\ I \arrow[drr, bend right, "p", swap] \arrow[r, "a", swap] & I \cup_A J \arrow[dr, "r", dashed]
							\\ & & A
						\end{tikzcd}
					\end{center}
					Then, $(I \cup_A J, \ell_0, \ell_1, r)$ is a cylinder object.
					\begin{proof} 
						We first compute
						\[ r \ell_0 = rai_0 = pi_0 = \id_A \]
						and similarly $r\ell_1 = \id_A$. Next, we note that $j_0, i_1$ are weak equivalences by 2-out-of-3. So the remaining arrows $a,b$ are also acyclic cofibrations by (C3). Since $a:I \to I \cup_A J$ and $p:I \to A$ are weak equivalences, also $r$ is a weak equivalence by 2-out-of-3. 
						\medskip \\Furthermore, the following is a pushout: \marginpar{\tiny Note that it is indeed the pushout from above.}
						\begin{center}
							\begin{tikzcd}
								& A \amalg A \amalg A \amalg A \arrow[rr, "i_0 + i_1 + j_0 + j_1", rightarrowtail] \arrow[d, "A \amalg \nabla \amalg A", swap] & & I \amalg J \arrow[d]
								\\ A \amalg A \arrow[r, rightarrowtail, "0 \& 1", swap] \arrow[rrr, "\ell_0 + \ell_1", bend right, swap] & A \amalg A \amalg A \arrow[rr, "\ell_0 + \ell_{1/2} + \ell_1", swap] & & I \cup_A J
							\end{tikzcd}
						\end{center}
						Here, $\ell_{1/2}$ is some map that we don't further care about. Note that the top map and the lower left map are cofibrations by \textbf{\ref{remark: immediate consequences of cofibration category}} and (C3). By (C3) also the right lower map is a cofibration and thus so is the composition $\ell_0 + \ell_1$. We have verified that our construction is indeed a cylinder.
					\end{proof}
				\end{quote} 
				Now let $H:I \to Z$ based on \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Glue together the homotopies.} $(I, i_0, i_1, p)$ be a homotopy from $f$ to $g$ and let $K:J \to Z$ based on $(J, j_0, j_1, q)$ be a homotopy from $g$ to $h$. Then, there is a unique morphism
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						A \arrow[r, "j_0"] \arrow[d, "i_1", swap] & J \arrow[ddr, bend left, "K"] \arrow[d, "b"]
						\\I \arrow[rrd, "H", swap, bend right] \arrow[r, "a", swap] & I \cup_A J \arrow[dr, dashed, "H \cup K", swap]
						\\ & & Z
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				The pushout condition is satisfied because $H$ ends at the same map that $K$ starts in. We get
				\[ (H \cup K) \ell_0 = (H \cup K) \circ a \circ i_0 = H \circ i_0 = f \]
				and
				\[ (H \cup K) \ell_1 = (H \cup K) \circ b \circ j_1 = K \circ j_1 = h, \]
				so $f \simeq h$.
			\end{itemize}
			\item Let $H:I \to Z$ be a homotopy based on $(I, i_0, i_1, p)$ from $f:A \to Z$ to $g:A \to Z$. Then,  $\phi \circ H:I \to Z'$ is a homotopy based on $(I, i_0, i_1, p)$ from $\phi f$ to $\phi g$.
			\item We  \marginpar{\footnotesize{\textsc{Lecture 11} \\ 23.05.2022}} let $(I, i_0, i_1, p)$ and $(J, j_0, j_1, q)$ be any cylinder objects for $A$ and $\ol{A}$. The left vertical morphism in

			is a cofibration by definition of cylinder objects. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright We do all of this first part because we don't have functoriality of cylinder objects.} So there is the pushout $J \cup_{\ol{A} \amalg \ol{A}} I$ exists by (C3) and we get a map
			\[ (\phi q) \cup p : J \cup_{\ol{A} \amalg \ol{A}} I \to A. \]
			We factor this through a cofibration
			\[ \ol{\phi} \cup t : J \cup_{\ol{A} \amalg \ol{A}} I \rightarrowtail I' \]
			and a weak equivalence
			\[ p' : I' \xrightarrow{\approx} A. \]
			via (C4). We set 
			\[ i_0' = ti_0, i_1' = ti_1 : A \to I'. \]
			Then, we have a commutative diagram 
			\begin{center}

					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				
				\begin{proof}
					Because $p$ and $p'$ are weak equivalences, so is $t$ by 2-out-of-3. Because $j_0 + j_1$ is a cofibration, so is its cobase change $I \to J \cup_{\ol{A} \amalg \ol{A}} I$ by (C3). Since $\ol{\phi} \cup t$ is a cofibration by definition, so is the composite

						\end{tikzcd}
					\end{center}
					is also a cofibration. Moreover, $p' i_k' = p i_k = \id_A$ by the commutativity of our diagram.

				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			Here, $s$ is an acyclic cofibration as the cobase change of an acyclic cofibration (C3). Take our $\ol{\phi} : J \to I'$ from above. Then,
			\[ K \ol{\phi} j_0 = K i_0' \phi = Kti_0 \phi = sHi_0 \phi = sf \phi. \]
			Similarly $K \ol{\phi} j_1 = s g \phi$, so $K \ol{\phi} : J \to Z'$ is the desired homotopy.

				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			which shows that $(I, i_0, i_1, p)$ is a cylinder object for $A$. We are using $q j_k = \id_{\ol{A}}$ to see that this is a cocone. Since $j_0 + j_1$ is a cofibration, so is its cobase change $i_0 + i_1$ by (C3). Moreover, $p$ is a weak equivalence by 2-out-of-3. Then, the diagram

		Here, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are acyclic cofibrations by (C3). Homotopy is compatible with postcomposition (\textbf{\ref{prop: basic properties of homotopy}}). So

		and

				\item For all pairs of homotopic $f,f':A \to Z$ we have $(f, \tau) \sim (f', \tau)$.

			We will show that postcomposition with a pair $(g:B \to Y, \sigma : C \overset{\approx}{\rightarrowtail} Y)$ is compatible with (1), (2) and (3). Precomposition \marginpar{\tiny \tr{Maybe check.}} is similar (and even slightly easier in case (3)).
			\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
				\item We choose two pushouts (using that pushouts stack)

						\\ & \ol{Z} \arrow[r, "\kappa"] & V
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				Then,
				\begin{align*}
					(\sigma \setminus g) \circ ((a \tau) \setminus (a f)) &= (\lambda \psi \sigma) \setminus (\kappa (a f))
					\\ &= (\lambda \psi \sigma) \setminus (\lambda \phi f)
					\\ &\overset{(1)}{\sim} (\psi \sigma) \setminus (\phi f)
					\\ &= (\sigma \setminus g) \circ (\tau \setminus f).
				\end{align*}
				\item If $f \simeq f'$ with the diagram
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						& B \arrow[r, "g"] \arrow[d, rightarrowtail, "{\tau, \approx}", swap] & Y \arrow[d, rightarrowtail, "{\psi, \approx}"]
						\\ A \arrow[r, shift left, "f"] \arrow[r, shift right, "f'", swap] & Z \arrow[r, "\phi", swap] & W
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				then $\phi f \simeq \phi f'$ by \textbf{\ref{prop: basic properties of homotopy}}, so $(\phi f, \psi \sigma) \overset{(2)}{\sim} (\phi f', \psi \sigma)$.
				\item We choose three pushouts
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						& B \arrow[r, "{\tau, \approx}"] \arrow[d, "g", swap] & Z \arrow[d, "\phi"]

						\\ Z \arrow[r, "\phi'", swap] & W' \arrow[r, rightarrowtail, "{\beta, \approx}", swap] & V
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				So by the commutativity of the diagram and \textbf{\ref{prop: basic properties of homotopy}} we get
				\[ \alpha \phi \tau = \alpha \psi g = \beta \psi' g = \beta \phi' \tau' \simeq \beta \phi' \tau. \]
				Therefore, $\alpha \phi \simeq \beta \phi'$ by \textbf{\ref{prop: basic properties of homotopy}}. By \textbf{\ref{prop: basic properties of homotopy}} there is an acyclic cofibration $s:V \to V'$ such that 
				\[ s \alpha \phi f \simeq s \beta \phi' f. \]
				Moreover, $s\alpha \psi \sigma = s \beta \psi' \sigma : C \to V'$ by the commutativity of the bottom right square. So the acyclic cofibrations $s \alpha : W \to V'$ and $s \beta:W' \to V'$ witness
				\[ (\phi f, \psi \sigma) \sim (\phi' f, \psi' \sigma). \]

Here, $q$ is a weak equivalence by 2-out-of-3. Then, $j$ is an acyclic cofibration by 2-out-of-3, so by (iii) the maps $\gamma(j)$ and $\gamma(r)$ are isomorphisms. Now
			\[ \gamma(q) \circ \gamma(r) = \gamma(qr) = \gamma(\id) = \id, \]

			\[ \gamma(f) = \gamma(qj) = \gamma(q) \circ \gamma(j) \]
			is an isomorphisms which also equals $\gamma(r)^{-1} \circ \gamma(j) = r \setminus j$.
			\item Let $F: \Ccat \to \Dc$ be any functor that takes weak equivalences to isomorphisms. We need to show
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\Ccat \arrow[r, "\gamma"] \arrow[dr, "F", swap] & \Ho(\Ccat) \arrow[d, dashed, "\exists ! G"]
					\\ & \Dc.

			We've seen this argument before.

				\textbf{Claim.} The functor $F$ takes the same values of homotopic morphisms.
				\begin{proof}
					Let $f,g:A \to B$ with a cylinder $(I, i_0, i_1, p)$ and a homotopy $H:I \to B$ with $Hi_0 = f$ and $Hi_1 = g$. Then, $F(p)$ is an isomorphism. So
					\[ F(p) \circ F(i_0) = F(pi_0) = F(\id) = F(p \circ i_1) = F(p) \circ F(i_1) \]
					showing $F(i_0) = F(i_1)$. Thus,
					\[ F(f) = F(Hi_0) = F(H) \circ F(i_0) = F(H) \circ F(i_1) = F(Hi_1) = F(g). \]
				\end{proof}
			\end{quote}
			Uniqueness of the factorization: Let $G: \Ho(\Ccat) \to \Dc$ with $G\gamma = F$. On objects, $\gamma$ is the identity, so $G(A) = F(A)$ on objects. On morphisms,
			\[ G(\tau \setminus f) = G(\gamma(\tau)^{-1} \circ \gamma(f))) = G(\gamma(\tau))^{-1} \circ G(\gamma(f)) = F(\tau)^{-1} \circ F(f). \]
			This forces uniqueness.
			\medskip \\For existence we put $G(A) = F(A)$ on objects and $G(\tau \setminus f) = F(\tau)^{-1} \circ F(f)$. For well-definedness recall that $\sim$ is generated by three elementary instances. The parts (2) and (3) are fine because $F$ is constant on homotopy classes. For (1) put
			\[ F(a \tau)^{-1} \circ F(af) = F(\tau)^{-1} \circ F(a)^{-1} \circ F(a) \circ F(f) = F(\tau)^{-1} \circ F(f). \]
			Left to show that $G$ is actually a functor. For compatibility with the identity
			\[ G(\id) = G(\id \setminus \id) = F(\id)^{-1} \circ F(\id) = \id. \]
			For compatibility with composition let us choose a pushout first:
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					& & C \arrow[d, rightarrowtail, "{\sigma, \approx}"]
					\\ & B \arrow[d, rightarrowtail, "{\tau, \approx}", swap] \arrow[r, "g"] & Y \arrow[d, "{\psi, \approx}", rightarrowtail] 
					\\ A \arrow[r, "f", swap] & Z \arrow[r, "\phi", swap] & W
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			So
			\[ F(\phi) \circ F(\tau) = F(\psi) \circ F(g) \implies F(\psi)^{-1} \circ F(\phi) = F(g) \circ F(\tau)^{-1}. \]
			Hence,
			\begin{align*}
				G((\sigma \setminus g) \circ (\tau \setminus f)) &= G((\psi \sigma) \setminus (\phi f))
				\\ &= F(\psi \sigma)^{-1} \circ F(\phi f)
				\\ &= F(\sigma)^{-1} \circ F(\psi)^{-1} \circ F(\phi) \circ F(f)
				\\ &= F(\sigma)^{-1} \circ F(g) \circ F(\tau)^{-1} \circ F(f)
				\\ &= G(\sigma \setminus g) \circ G(\tau \setminus f).
			\end{align*}

	\begin{corollary}[Calculus of fractions] \label{corollary: calculus of fractions}
		Let $\Ccat$ be a cofibration category and $\gamma : \Ccat \to \Ho(\Ccat)$ be a localization at the class of weak equivalences.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item Every morphism in $\Ho(\Ccat)$ is a \textbf{\tb{left fraction}}, i.e. of the form $\gamma(\tau)^{-1} \circ \gamma(f)$ for two $\Ccat$-morphisms $f, \tau$ with common target and $\tau$ an acyclic cofibration.
			\item Given \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Hey, this mimics the situation of localization of rings! It says that $\id \setminus f = \id \setminus g$ if and only if there exists an invertible $s$ with $sf \simeq sg$. For rings $S^{-1}R$ we have $\frac{r}{1} = \frac{r'}{1}$ if and only if there exists $s \in S$ with $sr' = sr$.} two morphisms $f,g : A \to B$ in $\Ccat$ we have $\gamma(f) = \gamma(g)$ if and only if there is an acyclic cofibration $s: B \overset{\approx}{\rightarrowtail} B'$ such that $sf \simeq sg$.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{corollary}

	\begin{proof}
		Not literally a corollary of \textbf{\ref{theorem: homotopy category of cofibration category}}.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item Literally a corollary of \textbf{\ref{theorem: homotopy category of cofibration category}}.
			\item We start with the converse. Suppose that $s$ is an acyclic cofibration with $sf \simeq sg$, then
			\[ \gamma(s) \circ \gamma(f) = \gamma(sf) = \gamma(sg) = \gamma(s) \circ \gamma(g). \]
			Since $\gamma(s)$ is invertible, we find $\gamma(f) = \gamma(g)$.
			\medskip \\Conversely, suppose that $\gamma(f) = \gamma(g)$, i.e. $(f, \id_B) \sim (g, \id_B)$. In other words, there are acyclic cofibrations $a:B \overset{\approx}{\rightarrowtail} \ol{Z}$ and $b:B \overset{\approx}{\rightarrowtail} \ol{Z}$ such that
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					& B \arrow[dr, equal] \arrow[d, "{a, \approx}", swap]

					\\ & B \arrow[u, "{b, \approx}"]
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			such that the triangles commute up to homotopy, i.e. $af \simeq bg$ and $a \simeq b$. We choose a pushout \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright We have $af \simeq bg$ but we want to postcompose by the same map $s$. So we postcompose with stuff and demand the compositions to agree via the pushout. Then, we still have to make sure that there is a homotopy. So we sort of correct some stuff step-by-step.}
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					B \arrow[r, rightarrowtail, "{b, \approx}"] \arrow[d, rightarrowtail, "{a, \approx}", swap] & Z \arrow[d, "\psi"]
					\\ Z \arrow[r, "\phi", swap] & W
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			Postcomposition preserves homotopy (\textbf{\ref{prop: basic properties of homotopy}}(ii)), so
			\[ \phi a = \psi b \simeq \psi a. \]
			Because $a$ is a weak equivalence, we get $\phi \simeq \psi$ (see \textbf{\ref{prop: basic properties of homotopy}}(iv)). By \textbf{\ref{prop: basic properties of homotopy}}(iii) there is an acyclic cofibration $t:W \to \ol{B}$ such that $t \phi a f \simeq t \psi a f$. Because homotopy is transitive (\textbf{\ref{prop: basic properties of homotopy}}(i)) we get
			\[ t \phi a f \simeq t \psi a f \simeq t \psi bg = t \phi ag. \]
			So the acyclic cofibration $t \phi a : B \to \ol{B}$ has the desired property.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proof}

	\noindent In a general localization it is hard to check whether two morphisms agree because theoretically one would need to check this on representatives as zig-zags of arbitrary length which is basically impossible to keep in check. So it is handy to have a more-or-less hands-on criterion for cofibration categories.

	\subsection{Some simple (co-)limits}
	
	An unfortunate feature of homotopy categories is that they tend to only have few (co-)limits. Moreover, in our setting of cofibration categories, limits and colimits will require different arguments because the notion of cofibration categories break symmetry (the opposite of a cofibration category is not a cofibration category).
	
	\begin{proposition} \label{prop: localization preserves coproducts}
		Let $\Ccat$ be a cofibration category.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item The localization functor $\gamma: \Ccat \to \Ho(\Ccat)$ preserves finite coproducts. In particular, $\Ho(\Ccat)$ has finite coproducts.
			\item Suppose that $\Ccat$ has arbitrary coproducts and coproducts of weak equivalences are weak equivalences and coproducts of cofibrations are cofibrations. Then, $\gamma: \Ccat \to \Ho(\Ccat)$ preserves arbitrary coproducts. In particular, $\Ho(\Ccat)$ has arbitrary coproducts in this case.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proposition}

	\begin{proof}
		We'll prove both parts together. Let $I$ be any set and $\{X_i \}_{i \in I}$ be a family of $\Ccat$-objects with coproduct $\bigvee_{i \in I} X_i$ and universal \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright If there are any $j$'s instead of $i$'s in this text: Schwede somehow sometimes writes $i$ and sometimes $j$. And I'm not even sure if it is simply because his handwriting is -- let's say -- improvable, so that his $i$'s look like $j$'s. I will try to change all $j$'s to $i$ but it's probably inevitable that I'll miss some...} morphisms $\kappa_i : X_i \to \bigvee_{i \in I} X_i$. We show that the image of this data under $\gamma: \Ccat \to \Ho(\Ccat)$ has the universal property of the coproduct: For every object $Y \in \Ccat$ (or $\Ho(\Ccat)$) the map
		\[ \Hom_{\Ho(\Ccat)}\left( \bigvee_{i \in I} X_i, Y \right) \to \prod_{i \in I} \Hom_{\Ho(\Ccat)}(X_i, Y), \ \psi \mapsto (\psi \circ \gamma(\kappa_i))_{i \in I} \]
		is bijective.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Surjectivity: Let $(\psi_i : X_i \to Y)_{i \in I}$ be an $I$-indexed family of morphisms in $\Ho(\Ccat)$. By the calculus of fractions (\textbf{\ref{corollary: calculus of fractions}}), there are $\Ccat$-morphisms $f_i:X_i \to W_i$ and acyclic cofibrations $s_i : Y \overset{\approx}{\rightarrowtail} W_i$ such that $\psi_i = \gamma(s_i)^{-1} \circ \gamma(f_i)$. We form the $\Ccat$-morphisms
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\bigvee_{i \in I} X_i \arrow[r, "\bigvee_{i \in I} f_i"] & \bigvee_{i \in I} W_i & & \bigvee_{i \in I} Y \arrow[ll, swap, "{\bigvee_{i \in I} s_i, \approx}", rightarrowtail] \arrow[r, "\nabla"] & Y
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			where we use the condition that coproducts preserve weak equivalences and cofibrations. This yields a morphism
			\[ \gamma(\nabla) \circ \gamma \left( \bigvee_{i \in I} s_i \right)^{-1} \circ \gamma \left( \bigvee_{i \in I} f_i \right) : \bigvee_{i \in I} X_i \to Y \]
			in $\Ho(\Ccat)$. Check that this is a preimage.
			{\scriptsize \medskip \\I feel like this is kind of evident but somehow still fiddly to make rigorous in this completely abstract setting. It boils down to the following commutative diagram:
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						X_i \arrow[rr, "\gamma(f_i)"] \arrow[d, "\gamma(\kappa_i)", swap] & & W_i \arrow[d] \arrow[rr, "\gamma(s_i)^{-1}"] & & Y \arrow[d] \arrow[dr, equal]
						\\ \bigvee_{i \in I} X_i \arrow[rr, "\gamma \left(\bigvee_{i \in I} f_i \right)", swap] & & \bigvee_{i \in I} W_i \arrow[rr, "\gamma \left(\bigvee_{i \in I} s_i \right)^{-1}", swap] & & \bigvee_{i \in I} Y \arrow[r, "\gamma(\nabla)", swap] & Y
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				So we end up with $\psi_i$ as desired.
			}
			\item Injectivity: Let $\psi, \psi': \bigvee_{i \in I} X_i \to Y$ be morphisms in $\Ho(\Ccat)$ such that
			\[ \psi \circ \gamma(\kappa_i) = \psi' \circ \gamma(\kappa_i) \]
			for all $i \in I$.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Case 1: Suppose $\psi = \gamma(f)$ and $\psi' = \gamma(f')$ for two $\Ccat$-morphisms $f,f' : \bigvee_{i \in I} X_i \to Y$. Then,
				\[ \gamma(f \kappa_i) = \gamma(f) \circ \gamma(\kappa_i) = \psi \circ \gamma(\kappa_i) = \psi' \circ \gamma(\kappa_i) = \gamma(f') \circ \gamma(\kappa_i) = \gamma(f' \kappa_i). \]
				By the calculus of fractions (\textbf{\ref{corollary: calculus of fractions}}) there exist acyclic cofibrations $t_i : Y \overset{\approx}{\rightarrowtail} \ol{Y}_i$ such that $t_j f \kappa_i \simeq t_i f' \kappa_i$ for $i \in I$. So there are cylinder objects for all $X_i$'s and homotopies $H_i : I_i \to \ol{Y}_i$ that witness these homotopies. We choose a pushout \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{This proof strategy still feels so weird to me. Any better intuition?}}
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						\bigvee_{i \in I} Y \arrow[r, "\nabla"] \arrow[d, rightarrowtail, "{\bigvee_i t_i, \approx}", swap] & Y \arrow[d, "t"]
						\\ \bigvee_{i \in I} \ol{Y}_i \arrow[r, "\nabla'", swap] & Y' \arrow[ul, phantom, "\ulcorner", very near start]
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				The left map is an acyclic cofibration because coproducts preserve cofibrations and weak equivalences by assumption. Thus, its cobase change $t$ is also an acyclic cofibration. 
				\medskip \\Moreover, the coproduct of the cylinder objects $\bigvee_{i \in I} I_i$ of all $X_i$'s is a cylinder object for $\bigvee_{i \in I} X_i$, also using that coproducts preserve cofibrations and weak equivalences.
				\medskip \\The map
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						\bigvee_{i \in I} I_i \arrow[r, "\bigvee_{i \in I} H_i"] & \bigvee_{i \in I} \ol{Y}_i \arrow[r, "\nabla'"] & Y'
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				is a homotopy from $tf$ to $tf'$. So $\gamma(tf) = \gamma(tf')$ in $\Ho(\Ccat)$. Since $t$ is a weak equivalence equivalence, we conclude $\gamma(f) = \gamma(f')$.
				{\scriptsize \medskip \\Indeed, taking e.g. the inclusion at the beginning into the cylinder object, we get the composition
					\begin{center}
						\begin{tikzcd}
							\bigvee_{i \in I} X_i \arrow[r, "i_0"] \arrow[rr, "\bigvee_{i \in I} (t_i f \kappa_i)", swap, bend right] & \bigvee_{i \in I} I_i \arrow[r, "\bigvee_{i \in I} H_i"] & \bigvee_{i \in I} \ol{Y}_i \arrow[r, "\nabla'"] & Y'
						\end{tikzcd}
					\end{center}
				and the previous commutative square helps us obtain \[ \nabla' \circ \left(\bigvee_{i \in I} H_i \right) \circ i_0 = \nabla' \circ \left( \bigvee_{i \in I} (t_i f \kappa_i) \right) = t \nabla \bigvee_{i \in I} (f \kappa_i) = tf. \]
				}
				\item Case 2: General case. Let $\psi, \psi' : \bigvee_{i \in I} X_i \to Y$ be morphisms in $\Ho(\Ccat)$ such that $\psi \circ \gamma(\kappa_i) = \psi' \circ \gamma(\kappa_i)$ for all $i \in I$. The calculus of fractions (\textbf{\ref{corollary: calculus of fractions}}) produces
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						\bigvee_{i \in I} X_i \arrow[r, "f"] & W & Y, \arrow[l, "{s, \approx}", swap] & \bigvee_{i \in I} X_i \arrow[r, "f'"] & W' & Y \arrow[l, "{s', \approx}", rightarrowtail, swap]
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				in $\Ccat$ such that $\psi = \gamma(s)^{-1} \circ \gamma(f)$ and $\psi' = \gamma(s')^{-1} \circ \gamma(f')$. We choose a pushout
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						Y \arrow[r, rightarrowtail, "{s, \approx}"] \arrow[d, "{s', \approx}", swap, rightarrowtail] & W \arrow[d, "t"]
						\\ W' \arrow[r, "t'", swap] & V
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				The maps $t,t'$ are acyclic cofibrations as cobase changes of acyclic cofibrations. Then,
				\[ \gamma(tf) \circ \gamma(\kappa_i) = \gamma(t) \circ \gamma(s) \circ \psi \circ \gamma(\kappa_i) = \gamma(t') \circ \gamma(s') \circ \psi' \circ \gamma(\kappa_i) = \gamma(t'f') \circ \gamma(\kappa_i) \]
				for all $i \in I$. By Case 1 we get $\gamma(tf) = \gamma(t' f')$. Thus, \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{Ok, I just really don't grok this proof strategy.}}
				\[ \gamma(ts) \circ \psi = \gamma(tf) = \gamma(t'f') = \gamma(t's') \circ \psi' \]
				Moreover, $\gamma(ts) = \gamma(t's')$ is an isomorphism, so $\psi = \psi'$.
				\end{itemize}

	\end{proof}

	\noindent This \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright There is a characterization of when the localization functor preserves coproducts in \url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.1324.pdf}.} is actually a strong statement because most likely a general localization functor does not preserve coproducts. On the other hand, this is hard to appreciate because one needs to construct or work with homotopy categories without coproducts first, whereas at this point of our mathematical careers possibly most important categories admit at least products and coproducts. And indeed, the proof of this fact is not completely straightforward, as we can see above.
	\medskip \\It's \marginpar{\footnotesize{\textsc{Lecture 13} \\ 30.05.2022}} a little surprising (at least it was to Schwede!) that the proof of the following result is actually quite similar to the above despite the asymmetry.
	
	\begin{theorem}
		Let $\Ccat$ be a cofibration category. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{Should this really be a theorem when the corresponding result for coproducts was a proposition?}} \label{theorem: localization preserves products}
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]

Then, $\gamma: \Ccat \to \Ho(\Ccat)$ preserves $I$-indexed products. In particular, $\Ho(\Ccat)$ has $I$-indexed products.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{theorem}

	\begin{proof}
		Be prepared for déjà-vus.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item Let $* \in \Ccat$ be terminal and let $p_A:A \to *$ be the unique $\Ccat$-morphism from an object $A$. Any morphism $A \to *$ in $\Ho(\Ccat)$ is of the form $\gamma(\tau)^{-1} \circ \gamma(f)$ for some $f:A \to Z$ and $\tau : * \xrightarrow{\approx} Z$ in $\Ccat$. The unique $\Ccat$-morphism $p_Z:Z \to *$ is left-inverse to $\tau$, so $p_Z$ is also a weak equivalence by 2-ouf-of-3. Moreover, $\gamma(p_Z) = \gamma(\tau)^{-1}$. So
			\[ \gamma(\tau)^{-1} \circ \gamma(f) = \gamma(p_Z) \circ \gamma(f) = \gamma(p_Z f :A \to *) = \gamma(p_A). \]
			So there is a unique morphism $A \to *$ in $\Ho(\Ccat)$. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Note that there is at least one given by $p_A$.}
			\item Let \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \raggedright As always, I really don't care about the exam but this might be exam material if he's already presented essentially the same argument twice...} $\{X_i \}_{i \in I}$ be an $I$-family of $\Ccat$-objects. Let $\prod_{i \in I} X_i$ be a product in $\Ccat$ with universal morphisms $p_j: \prod_{i \in I} X_i \to X_j$. We must show that for all $A \in \Ccat$ the map
			\[ \Hom_{\Ho(\Ccat)}\left(A, \prod_{i \in I} X_i \right) \to \prod_{j \in I} \Hom_{\Ho(\Ccat)}(A, X_j), \ \psi \mapsto (\gamma(p_j) \circ \psi)_{j \in I} \]
			is bijective. We'll show surjectivity and injectivity separately.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Surjectivity: We consider an $I$-family of $\Ho(\Ccat)$-morphisms $\psi_j :A \to X_j$ for $j \in I$. The calculus of fractions provides $\Ccat$-morphisms $f_j : A \to Z_j$ and acyclic cofibrations $s_j : X_j \overset{\approx}{\rightarrowtail} Z_j$ such that $\psi_j = \gamma(s_j)^{-1} \circ \gamma(f_j)$. Then,
				\[ \prod_{j \in I} s_j : \prod_{j \in I} X_j \to \prod_{j \in I} Z_j \]
				is another weak equivalence by assumption. We claim that the morphism
				\[ \gamma \left( \prod_{j \in I} s_j \right)^{-1} \circ \gamma \left((f_i)_{i \in I} \right) : A \to \prod_{i \in I} X_i \]
				is a preimage of $(\psi_j)_{j \in I}$. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Note that there is some abuse of notation: These are different $p_j$'s.}

						\\ & Z_j & & X_j \arrow[ll, "{s_j, \approx}"]
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				We get
				\begin{align*}
					\gamma(p_j) \circ \gamma \left( \prod_{j \in I} s_j \right)^{-1} \circ \gamma((f_i)_{i \in I}) &= \gamma(s_j)^{-1} \circ \gamma(p_j) \circ \gamma((f_i)_{i \in I})
					\\ &= \gamma(s_j)^{-1} \circ \gamma(f_j)
					\\ &= \psi_j.
				\end{align*}
				\item Injectivity: Let $\phi, \psi:A \to \prod_{i \in I} X_i$ be two morphisms in $\Ho(\Ccat)$ such that 
				\[ \gamma(p_j) \circ \phi = \gamma(p_j) \circ \psi \]
				for all $j \in I$. We'll \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{I should definitely try proving the general case.}} only do a special case, namely $\phi = \gamma(f)$ and $\psi = \gamma(g)$ for some $\Ccat$-morphisms $f,g:A \to \prod_{i \in I} X_i$. Then,
				\[ \gamma(p_j \circ f) = \gamma(p_j) \circ \phi = \gamma(p_j) \circ \psi = \gamma(p_j \circ g). \]
				The calculus of fractions (\textbf{\ref{corollary: calculus of fractions}}) provides weak equivalences $s_j : X_j \xrightarrow{\approx} \ol{X}_j$ such that $s_j p_j f \simeq s_j p_j g$. So there are cylinder objects $(I^j, \iota_0^j, \iota_1^j, p_j)_{j \in I}$ for $A$ and homotopies
				\[ H^j:I^j \to \ol{X}_j \quad \text{from $s_j p_j f$ to $s_j p_j g$}. \]
				Each of the morphisms $p^j : I^j \to A$ is a weak equivalence by definition of cylinder objects. So also $\prod_{j \in I} p^j : \prod_{j \in I} I^j \to \prod_{j \in I} A$ is also a weak equivalence by assumption. So the two morphisms $\prod_j \iota_0^j, \prod_j \iota_1^j : \prod_{j \in I} A \to \prod_{j \in I} I^j$ are both right inverse to the equivalence $\prod_{j \in I} p^j$. Thus, $\gamma \left( \prod_{j \in I} \iota_0^j \right), \gamma \left( \prod_{j \in I} \iota_1^j \right)$ are both right inverses of the isomorphism $\gamma \left( \prod_{j \in I} p^j \right)$ which means that they must agree.
				\medskip \\We let $\Delta : A \to \prod_{i \in I} A$ be the diagonal, i.e. $p_j \circ \Delta = \id_A$ for all $j \in I$. Then,
				\begin{align*}
					\gamma \left(\prod_{i \in I} s_i \right) \circ \phi &= \gamma \left( \prod_{i \in I} s_i \right) \circ \gamma(f) 
					\\ &= \gamma \left( \prod_{i \in I}s_i p_i f \right) \circ \gamma(\Delta)
					\\ &= \gamma \left( \prod_{i \in I}H^i \circ \iota^i_0 \right) \circ \gamma(\Delta)
					\\ &= \gamma \left( \prod_{i \in I} H^i \right) \circ \gamma \left( \prod_{i \in I} \iota_0^i \right) \circ \gamma(\Delta)
					\\ &= \gamma \left( \prod_{i \in I} H^i \right) \circ \gamma \left( \prod_{i \in I} \iota_1^i \right) \circ \gamma(\Delta)
					\\ &= \gamma \left( \prod_{i \in I} (H^i \circ \iota_1^i) \right) \circ \gamma(\Delta)
					\\ &= \gamma \left( \prod_{i \in I} (s_i p_i g) \right) \circ \gamma(\Delta)
					\\ &= \gamma \left( \prod_{i \in I} s_i \right) \circ \gamma(g)
					\\ &= \gamma \left( \prod_{i \in I} s_i \right) \circ \psi.
				\end{align*}
				Since $\gamma \left(\prod_{i \in I} s_i \right)$ is an isomorphism, we deduce $\phi = \psi$.

	According to a 'raise your hands poll' quite a lot of people seem to know about additive categories already! Often, pre-additivity \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright OK, this is actually weird because for Schwede's definition we only get an $\CMon$-enrichment.} is defined as an $\Ab$-enriched category, so pre-additivity comes with additional structure here. Instead, Schwede wants to present a definition in which additivity is a property and not a structure.
	
	\begin{definition}
		A category $\Ccat$ is \textbf{\tb{pre-additive}} if \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Equivalently, the natural map $X \amalg Y \to X \times Y$ induced by $p_1, p_2$ is an isomorphism!} it has a zero object, finite coproducts and for all pairs of objects $X, Y$ and coproduct $X \amalg Y$ the two morphisms
		\[ p_1 = \id_X + 0 : X \amalg Y \to X, \quad p_2 = 0 + \id_Y : X \amalg Y \to Y \]
		where $0$ is the unique morphism factoring through the zero object, make $X \amalg Y$ into a product of $X$ and $Y$.
	\end{definition}

	\noindent In other words: For all $\Ccat$-objects $A$ the map
	\[ \Ccat(A, X \amalg Y) \to \Ccat(A, X) \times \Ccat(A, Y), \ f \mapsto (p_1 f, p_2 f) \]
	is bijective.
	
	\begin{example}
		For example $\Ab, \Mod_R, \CMon$ or $D(R)$ for a ring spectrum $R$ are additive categories (for $D(R)$ see \textbf{\ref{prop: direct sums, products, wedges of spectra}}).
	\end{example}

	\begin{construction}
		Let $\Ccat$ be pre-additive and let $a,b : A \to X$ be two $\Ccat$-morphisms. Write $\tb{a \perp b} : A \to X \amalg X$ for the unique morphism such that
		\[ p_1 \circ (a \perp b) = a \quad \text{and} \quad p_2 \circ (a \perp b) = b. \]
		The \textbf{\tb{sum}} of $a$ and $b$ is defined by 
		\[ \tb{a+b} = \nabla(a \perp b) = (1+1)(a \perp b). \]
		Pictorially:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				A \arrow[r, "a \perp b"] & X \amalg X \arrow[r, "\nabla"] & X.
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
	\end{construction}

	\begin{proposition}
		Let $\Ccat$ be a pre-additive category.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item For all \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright I.e. $\CMon$-enriched.} $\Ccat$-objects $A,X$ the binary operation $+$ makes $\Ccat(A, X)$ into an abelian monoid. Composition is biadditive.
			\item If the \textbf{\tb{shear morphism}} $\nabla \perp p_1 : X \amalg X \to X \amalg X$ \marginpar{\tiny Think $\m{1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1}$.} is an isomorphism, then $\Ccat(A, X)$ is an abelian group.
			\item Let $F: \Ccat \to \CMon$ be a functor that preserves \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright I guess this comes from functoriality: $\Ccat(A,X) \to \CMon(FA, FX)$ which corresponds to $\Ccat(A,X) \times FA \to FX$ given by $(f,a) \mapsto F(f)a$.} zero objects and finite coproducts. Then, for all $\Ccat$-objects $A,X$ and all $a \in F(A)$ the map
			\[ \Ccat(A, X) \to F(X), \ f \mapsto f_*(a) = F(f)a \]
			is a monoid homomorphism.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proposition}

	\begin{proof}
		Let's at least do some parts of this.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item We'll show associativity of $+$. Let $a,b,c : A \to X$. We contemplate the following diagram:
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					& & X \amalg X \arrow[dr, "\nabla"]
					\\ A \arrow[r] & X \amalg X \amalg X \arrow[ur, "\id_X \amalg \nabla"] \arrow[dr, "\nabla \amalg \id_X", swap] & & X
					\\ & & X \amalg X \arrow[ur, "\nabla", swap]
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			which commutes by the universal property of coproducts. But going through this diagram in both ways amounts to associativity.
			\medskip \\For commutativity we first note $b \perp a = (a \perp b) \circ \tau$ where $\tau = i_2 + i_1 : X \amalg X \to X \amalg X$ is the flip morphism. So $p_1 \tau = p_2$ and $p_2 \tau = p_1$. We compute
			\[ p_1(b \perp a) = b \quad \text{and} \quad p_1 \tau(a \perp b) = p_2(a \perp b) = b. \]
			Thus,
			\[ a+b = \nabla \circ (a \perp b) = \nabla \circ \tau \circ (a \perp b) = \nabla \circ (b \perp a) = b + a. \]
			Omitted: The $0$-morphism is the neutral element for addition in $\Ccat(A, X)$.
			\medskip \\For biadditivity let $A \xrightarrow{a,b} X \xrightarrow{c} Y$. Consider
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					A \arrow[d, "a \perp b", swap] \arrow[r, "a \perp b"] \arrow[rr, bend left, "ca \perp cb"] & X \amalg X \arrow[d, "\nabla"] \arrow[r, "c \amalg c"] & Y \amalg Y \arrow[d, "\nabla"]
					\\ X \amalg X \arrow[r, "\nabla", swap] & X \arrow[r, "c", swap] & Y
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			For this note
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					X \amalg X \arrow[r, "c \amalg c"] \arrow[d, "p_1 = \id_X + 0", swap] & Y \amalg Y \arrow[d, "p_1 = \id_Y + 0"]
					\\ X \arrow[r, "c", swap] & Y
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			So
			\[ p_1(c \amalg c)(a \perp b) = cp_1(a \perp b) = ca = p_1(ca \perp cb) \]
			and
			\[ p_2(c \amalg c)(a \perp b) = p_2(ca \perp cb) \]
			which shows the commutativity of the upper part. The commutativity of the entire diagram amounts to $c(a+b) = (ca)+(cb)$.
			\item We assume that $\nabla \perp p_1 : X \amalg X \to X \amalg X$ is an isomorphism. Note:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item An abelian monoid $M$ is a group if and only if the map
				\[ M^2 \to M^2, \ (x,y) \mapsto (x,x+y) \]
				is bijective. Indeed, the preimage of $(x,0)$ would give $(x,-x)$, so it gives us the inverse of $x$.
				\item Every morphism $f:A \to X \amalg X$ satisfies $f = (p_1 f) \perp (p_2 f)$. Hence,
				\[ (p_1 f) + (p_2 f) = \nabla ((p_1 f) \perp (p_2 f)) = \nabla f. \]
			\end{itemize}
			So the following square commutes:
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					{\Ccat(A, X \amalg X)} \arrow[rr, "(\nabla \perp p_1) \circ -"] \arrow[d, "{f \mapsto (p_1 f, p_2 f)}", swap] & & {\Ccat(A, X \amalg X)} \arrow[d, "{f \mapsto (p_1 f, p_2 f)}"]
					\\ {\Ccat(A, X)^2} \arrow[rr, "{(a,b) \mapsto (a,a+b)}", swap ] & & {\Ccat(A,X)^2}
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center} 
			The upper three maps are isomorphisms, so also the lower map is an isomorphism. So $\Ccat(A,X)$ is an abelian group.
			\item Let $F:\Ccat \to \AbMon$ be a finite coproduct-preserving functor (with $F(0) = 0$). Then, for all $a \in F(A)$ we show that the map
			\[ \Ccat(A, X) \to F(X), \ f \mapsto f_*(a) \]
			is additive. 
			\medskip \\Schwede: \emph{Because $F(0) = 0$, also $F(0) = 0$.} 
			\medskip \\Well. Up to some abuse of notation. More precisely, because $F$ preserves zero objects, it preserves zero morphisms.
			\begin{quote}
				\textbf{Claim.} For all $X \in \Ccat$ we have
				\[ F(p_1) + F(p_2) = F(\nabla). \]
				Recall \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright This is a special case of what we want to prove and will actually turn out to be a universal case.} $p_1 = \id+0, p_2 = 0+\id, \nabla = \id + \id : X \amalg X \to X$.
				
				\begin{proof}
					Let $i_1, i_2 : X \to X \amalg X$ be the universal morphisms of the coproduct. Then,
					\begin{align*}
						F(\nabla) \circ F(i_1) &= F(\nabla \circ i_1) 
						\\ &= F(\id_X) 
						\\ &= F(\id_X) + F(0) 
						\\ &= F(p_1 \circ i_1) + F(p_2 \circ i_1)
						\\ &= (F(p_1) + F(p_2)) \circ F(i_1)
					\end{align*} 
					where the latter $+$ is from abelian monoids and in particular biadditive. Similarly,
					\[ F(\nabla) \circ F(i_2) = (F(p_1) + F(p_2)) \circ F(i_2). \]
					The map
					\[ F(i_1) + F(i_2) : F(X) \oplus F(X) \to F(X \amalg X), \ (x,y) \mapsto F(i_1)(x) + F(i_2)(x) \]
					is bijective because $F$ preserves coproducts. This implies $F(\nabla) = F(p_1) + F(p_2)$.
				\end{proof}
			\end{quote}
			So for two $\Ccat$-morphisms $f,g : A \to X$ we get
			\begin{align*}
				F(f+g) &= F(\nabla \circ (f \perp g))
				\\ &= F(\nabla) \circ F(f \perp g)
				\\ &= (F(p_1) + F(p_2)) \circ F(f \perp g)
				\\ &= (F(p_1) \circ F(f \perp g)) + (F(p_2) \circ F(f \perp g))
				\\ &= F(f) + F(g)
			\end{align*}
			where we use that the latter composition $\circ$ is the composition in $\CMon$ which is biadditive.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proof}

	\noindent Part (iii) will actually be quite useful to check some naturalities for us later.

	\begin{definition}
		A category $\Ccat$ is \textbf{\tb{additive}} if it is preadditive and for all objects $X$ the morphism $\nabla \perp p_1 : X \amalg X \to X \amalg X$ is an isomorphism.
	\end{definition}

	\noindent Thus, all morphism sets $\Ccat(A, X)$ admit the structure of abelian groups.
	\medskip \\The following is the first instance which shows that when we work over $D(R)$ we are really doing some sort of algebra. It is also sort of why we did all of the cofibration business. And again Schwede gives the interlude on him trying to find a simpler argument on this point. As we know by now, he failed.
	
	\begin{theorem}
		Let $R$ be a ring spectrum.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item The localization functor $\gamma: {}_R \Mod \to D(R)$ preserves arbitrary coproducts and finite products. In particular, $D(R)$ has arbitrary coproducts and finite products. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright It actually also has arbitrary products but we don't get that immediately.}
			\item The derived category $D(R)$ is additive.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{theorem}

	\begin{proof}
		Luckily, we've already done most of the work.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item Localization of nice enough cofibration \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright We cannot get the result for infinite products because stable equivalences are not stable under infinite products. See \textbf{\#4.1}.} categories (\textbf{\ref{theorem: cofibration structure on R-Mod}}) preserves arbitrary coproducts (\textbf{\ref{prop: localization preserves coproducts}}) and finite products (\textbf{\ref{theorem: localization preserves products}}).
			\item For all $R$-modules $M,N$ the canonical map $M \vee N \to M \times N$ in ${}_R \Mod$ is a stable equivalence (\textbf{\ref{prop: direct sums, products, wedges of spectra}}), so it becomes an isomorphism in $D(R)$. Because $\gamma : {}_R \Mod \to D(R)$ preserves finite coproducts and finite products by (i), this shows that finite coproducts in $D(R)$ are products. So $D(R)$ is preadditive.
			\medskip \\The composite
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\pi_k(M) \oplus \pi_k(M) \arrow[r, "\sim"] \arrow[rrr, bend right, swap, "{(x,y) \mapsto (x+y, y)}"] & \pi_k(M \vee M) \arrow[r, "\nabla \perp p_1"] & \pi_k(M \times M) \arrow[r, "\sim"] & \pi_k(M) \times \pi_k(M)
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			commutes in $D(R)$. Note that the bottom map is the shear map which is an isomorphism because we are dealing with abelian groups. Thus, also the shear map $\nabla \perp p_1$ is an isomorphism in $D(R)$. So $D(R)$ is additive.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proof}
	
	\noindent Typically \marginpar{\footnotesize{\textsc{Lecture 14} \\ 01.06.2022}} it's pretty hard to calculate morphism 'sets' in localizations. So it seems sensible to give a (more or less) explicit calculation.
	
	\begin{construction}
		Let $E$ be a sequential spectrum and $A$ be a based space. We use the ad hoc notation
		\[ \tb{E\{A \}} = \colim_n {[S^n \wedge A, E_n]_*} \]
		where the colimit is taken over
		\[ [S^n \wedge A, E_n]_* \xrightarrow{S^1 \wedge -} [S^1 \wedge S^n \wedge A, S^1 \wedge E_n]_* \xrightarrow{(\sigma_n)_*} [ S^{1+n} \wedge A, E_{1+n}]_*. \]
	\end{construction}
	
	\begin{remark} \label{remark: first remarks for E A}
		This is really a generalization of the notion of homotopy groups.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item For $n \geq 2$, the \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{Do you need $n \geq 2$ for the abelian part?}} set $[S^n \wedge A, E_n]_*$ has an abelian group structure by 'pinching'. Indeed, let $f,g : S^n \wedge A \to E_n$. Then, the group operation is given by 
			\[ S^n \wedge A \xrightarrow{\operatorname{pinch}} (S^n \vee S^n) \wedge A \cong (S^n \wedge A) \vee (S^n \wedge A) \xrightarrow{f+g} E_n. \]
			\item For $n \geq 2$ the \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright The most important step in this proof is seeing that $\Sigma \pinch$ is homotopic to the pinch map (in a higher dimension). This can be checked via a more formal characterization of the pinch map (see \textbf{\#1.2} from AlgTop1).} stabilization maps are group homomorphisms, so $E \{A \}$ is an abelian group.
			\item If $A = S^k$, then $S^n \wedge S^k \cong S^{n+k}$, so $[S^n \wedge S^k, E_n]_* \cong \pi_{n+k}(E_n)$. Thus, $E \{S^k \} \cong \pi_k(E)$.
			\item More generally,
			\begin{align*}
				E \{A \} &= \colim_n {[S^n \wedge A, E_n]_*} \cong \colim_n {[S^n, \map_*(A, E_n)]_* }
				\\ &= \colim_n \pi_n(\map_*(A, E_n)) 
				\\ &= \pi_0(\map_*(A, E))
			\end{align*} 
			where one does have to do a little checking to show that the maps are compatible with the colimit system.
			\medskip \\Recall: If $A$ admits the structure of a finite CW complex, then $\map_*(A, -)$ preserves stable equivalences (\textbf{\ref{prop: preservations of stable equivalences}}). Hence,
			\[ \pi_0(\map_*(A, -)) \cong (-)\{A \} : \Sp^{\N} \to \Ab \]
			takes stable equivalences to isomorphisms.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{remark}

	\noindent Let $R$ be an orthogonal ring spectrum and $A$ be a based space. The \textbf{\tb{tautological class}} is the element $\tb{\iota_A} \in (R \wedge A) \{A \}$ represented by 
	\[ \iota_0 \wedge A : S^0 \wedge A \to R(0) \wedge A. \]
	
	\begin{theorem} \label{theorem: representing functor from derived category}
		Let $R$ be an orthogonal ring spectrum and $A$ be a based space that admits the structure of a finite CW complex.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item The functor $(-)\{A \} : {}_R \Mod \to \Ab$ takes stable equivalences to isomorphisms.
			\item Let $\Phi : {}_R \Mod \to \Set$ be any functor that takes stable equivalences to isomorphisms. The evaluation at $\iota_A$ 
			\[ \Nat_{{}_R \Mod \to \Set}((-)\{A \}, \Phi) \to \Phi(R \wedge A), \ (\tau:(-)\{A \} \to \Phi) \mapsto \tau_{R \wedge A}(\iota_A) \]
			is a bijection. \marginpar{\tiny This is a bit similar (I guess in a special case?) to $(-)[k]$ for $D(R)$ with a ring $R$. There, this functor represents the $k$-th homology.}
			\item The pair $(R \wedge A, \iota_A)$ represents the functor 
			\[ D(R) \to \Set, \ M \mapsto M \{A \}, \]
			i.e. the map
			\[ \Hom_{D(R)}(R \wedge A, M) \to M \{A \}, \ \id_{R \wedge A} \mapsto \iota_A \]
			is a bijection.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{theorem}

	\begin{proof}
		Mainly to have the main statement on the board.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item See \textbf{\ref{remark: first remarks for E A}}(iv).
			\item Let's do injectivity and surjectivity separately.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Injectivity: Let $\tau : (-) \{A \} \to \Phi$ be any natural transformation. Let $M$ be any $R$-module, and let $f:S^n \wedge A \to M_n$ be any based continuous map, representing a class in $M \{A \}$. Let $f^{\flat} : A \to \Omega^n M_n$ be the adjoint of $f$. Then, there is a unique morphism of $R$-modules 
				\[ f^{\sharp}: R \wedge A \to \Omega^n \sh^n M \]
				such \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Heuritically, the left functor is the free functor.} that the composite
				\[ A \xrightarrow{\iota_0 \wedge -} R(0) \wedge A \xrightarrow{f^{\sharp}_0} (\Omega^n \sh^n M)(0) = \Omega^n M_n \]
				is $f^{\flat}$. The value of $f^{\sharp}$ at an inner product space $V$ is
				\[ R(V) \wedge A \xrightarrow{R(V) \wedge f^{\flat}} R(V) \wedge \Omega^n M(\R^n) \xrightarrow{\alpha_{V, \R^n}} (\Omega^n M)(V \oplus \R^n) = (\Omega^n \sh^n M)(V). \]
				{\scriptsize It is crucial to note that $f^{\sharp}$ is demanded to be a map of $R$-modules. This yields
					\[ f_V^{\sharp} \circ \alpha_{V0} \circ (R(V) \wedge \iota_0 \wedge A) = \alpha_{V0} \circ (R(V) \wedge f_0^{\#}) \circ (R(V) \wedge \iota_0 \wedge A) = \alpha_{V0} \circ (R(V) \wedge f^{\flat}) \]
				using also the given condition. On the other hand, the left side differs to $f_V^{\sharp}$ by a flip isomorphism as demonstrated in
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						R(V) \wedge S^0 \wedge A \arrow[d, "\twist \wedge A", swap] \arrow[rr, "R(V) \wedge \iota_0 \wedge A"] & & R(V) \wedge R(0) \wedge A \arrow[r, "\alpha_{V0} \wedge A"] & R(V) \wedge A \arrow[r, "f_V^{\sharp}"] & (\Omega^n \sh^n M)(V)
						\\ S^0 \wedge R(V) \wedge A \arrow[urrr, "\sigma_{0V} \wedge A = \id", swap, bend right] 
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				and so it uniquely determines $f^{\sharp}$. OK but note further that this flip isomorphism doesn't really do anything since we are dealing with $S^0$, so the left hand side really amounts to $f^{\sharp}_V$ (the isomorphism forgetting the $S^0$ is also on the right side). On the other hand, on the right side we should more precisely write $\alpha_{V0} = \alpha_{V0}^{\sh^n M} = \alpha_{V, \R^n}^M$. So we obtain the proposed $f^{\sharp}$.
					\medskip \\
				}
				With $f^{\sharp} \{A \} : (R \wedge A) \{A \} \to (\Omega^n \sh^n M)\{A \}$ the above map satisfies \marginpar{\tiny \tr{Check.}}
				\[ f^{\sharp} \{A \}(\iota_A) = \tilde{\lambda}_M^n \{A \}[f] \]
				where $\tilde{\lambda}_M^n : M \xrightarrow{\approx} \Omega^n \sh^n M$ is the adjoint of $\lambda_M^n : M \wedge S^n \xrightarrow{\approx} \sh^n M$ by unfolding all the definitions. Here, $\tilde{\lambda}_M^n$ is a weak equivalence (\textbf{\ref{theorem: lambda are stable equivalences}}).
				\medskip \\By naturality of $\tau$ we get the following commutative diagram. 
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						(R \wedge A) \{A \} \arrow[r, "f^{\sharp} \{A \}"] \arrow[d, "\tau_{R \wedge A}"] & (\Omega^n \sh^n M)\{A \} \arrow[d, "\tau_{\Omega^n \sh^n M}"] & & M \{A \}  \arrow[ll, "{\tilde{\lambda}_M^n \{A \}}", swap] \arrow[d, "\tau_M"]
						\\ \Phi(R \wedge A) \arrow[r, "\Phi(f^{\sharp})", swap] & \Phi(\Omega^n \sh^n M) & & \Phi(M) \arrow[ll, "{\Phi(\tilde{\lambda}^n_M), \cong}"]
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				We deduce
				\begin{align*}
					\Phi(f^{\sharp})(\tau_{R \wedge A}(\iota_A)) &= \tau_{\Omega^n \sh^n M}(f^{\sharp}\{A \}(\iota_A))
					\\ &= \tau_{\Omega^n \sh^n M}(\tilde{\lambda}^n_M \{A \}[f])
					\\ &= \Phi(\tilde{\lambda}_M^n)(\tau_M[f]),
				\end{align*}
				and thus
				\[ \tau_M[f] = \Phi(\tilde{\lambda}_M^n)^{-1}(\Phi(f^{\sharp}(\tau_{R \wedge A}(\iota_A)))) \]
				using that $\Phi(\tilde{\lambda}^n_M)$ is an isomorphism since $\Phi$ sends stable equivalences to isomorphisms. Altogether, $\tau$ is determined by $\tau_{R \wedge A}(\iota_A)$ which shows injectivity.
				\item Surjectivity: Let $y \in \Phi(R \wedge A)$ be an element. We must construct a natural transformation $\tau : (-) \{A \} \to \Phi$ such that $\tau_{R \wedge A}(\iota_A) = y$. Now let $M$ be any $R$-module, and let $f:S^n \wedge A \to M_n$ represent any given class in $M \{A \}$. Then, we define
				\[ \tau_M [f] = \Phi(\tilde{\lambda}^n_M)^{-1} \left(\Phi(f^{\sharp})(y) \right). \]
				This is well-defined: It does not change if we
				\begin{itemize}
					\item change $f$ into a homotopic $f'$,
					\item if we stabilize $f$ to $\sigma_n \circ (S^1 \wedge f)$.
				\end{itemize}
				Let's only check the second part. The following diagram commutes: \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Note that $\Omega$ and $\sh$ commute on the nose. \tr{But why does this diagram commute?}}
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						R \wedge A \arrow[r, "f^{\sharp}"] \arrow[dr, bend right, "(\sigma_n \circ (S^1 \wedge f))^{\sharp}", swap] & \Omega^n \sh^n M \arrow[d, "{\tilde{\lambda}_{\Omega^n \sh^n M}, \approx}"] & M \arrow[l, "\tilde{\lambda}_M^n", swap] \arrow[dl, bend left, "{\tilde{\lambda}_M^{1+n}, \approx}"]
						\\ & \Omega^{1+n} \sh^{1+n} M
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				Thus,
				\begin{align*}
					\Phi(\tilde{\lambda}^n_M)^{-1} \left(\Phi(f^{\sharp}(y) \right) &= \left(\Phi(\tilde{\lambda}_M^{1+n})^{-1} \circ \Phi(\lambda_{\Omega^n \sh^n M}) \circ \Phi(f^{\sharp}) \right)(y)
					\\ &= \left(\Phi(\tilde{\lambda}_M^{1+n})^{-1} \circ \Phi((\sigma_n(S^1 \wedge f))^{\sharp}) \right)(y)
				\end{align*}
				For naturality: Let $\psi:M \to N$ be a morphism of $R$-modules and let $f:S^n \wedge A \to M_n$. Then, $\psi_*[f]$ is represented by $\psi_n \circ f : S^n \wedge A \to N_n$. The following diagram in ${}_R \Mod$ commutes:
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						R \wedge A \arrow[r, "f^{\sharp}"] \arrow[dr, "(\psi_n \circ f)^{\sharp}", swap, bend right] & \Omega^n \sh^n M \arrow[d, "\Omega^n \sh^n \psi"] & & M \arrow[ll, "{\tilde{\lambda}_M^n, \approx}", swap] \arrow[d, "\psi"]
						\\ & \Omega^n \sh^n N & & N \arrow[ll, "{\tilde{\lambda}^n_N, \approx}"]
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				Therefore,
				\begin{align*}
					\tau_N(\psi\{A \}[f]) &= \left(\Phi(\tilde{\lambda}_N^n)^{-1} \circ \Phi((\psi_n \circ f)^{\sharp}) \right)(y)
					\\ &= \left(\Phi(\tilde{\lambda}^n_N)^{-1} \circ \Phi(\Omega^n \sh^n \psi) \circ \Phi(f^{\sharp}) \right)(y)
					\\ &= \left(\Phi(\psi) \circ \Phi(\tilde{\lambda}^n_M)^{-1} \circ \Phi(f^{\sharp}) \right)(y)
					\\ &= \Phi(f)(\tau_M[f]).
				\end{align*}
				So everything is well-defined and we compute $\tilde{\lambda}_{R \wedge A}^0 = \id_{R \wedge A}$ and $(\iota_0 \wedge A)^{\sharp} = \id_{R \wedge A}$, so we conclude
				\[ \tau_{R \wedge A}(\iota_A) = \Phi(\id_{R \wedge A})(y) = y. \]
			\end{itemize}
			\item Applying (ii) to $D(R)(R \wedge A, -) \circ \gamma : {}_R \Mod \to \Set$ shows there is a unique natural transformation
			\[ \tau : (-)\{A \} \to D(R)(R \wedge A, -) \]
			such that $\tau_{R \wedge A}(\iota_A) = \id_{R \wedge A}$. The Yoneda Lemma provides a unique natural transformation 
			\[ j:D(R)(R \wedge A, -) \to (-) \{A \} \quad \text{such that} \quad  j_{R \wedge A}(\id_{R \wedge A}) = \iota_A. \] 
			Then, $j \circ \tau : (-) \{A \} \to (-) \{A \}$ sends $\iota_A$ to $\iota_A$. So $j \circ \tau = \id_{(-)\{A \}}$ by uniqueness in (ii). Moreover, $\tau \circ j : D(R \wedge A, -) \to D(R \wedge A, -)$ takes $\id_{R \wedge A}$ to $\id_{R \wedge A}$, so $\tau \circ j = \id$ by the uniqueness of the Yoneda Lemma. In particular, $j$ is a natural isomorphism 
			\[ j_M: D(R)(R \wedge A, M) \xrightarrow{\sim} M \{A \}. \]
			{\scriptsize Here's a compact way of formulating (iii): First of all, the bijection in (ii) in natural in $\Phi$. This amounts to the following commutative diagram given for natural transformations $\alpha:\Phi \to \Psi$ between homotopical functors $\Phi, \Psi : {}_R \Mod \to \Set$:
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						\Nat((-)\{A \}, \Phi) \arrow[r] \arrow[d, "\alpha_*", swap] & \Phi(R \wedge A) \arrow[d, "\alpha_{R \wedge A}"] & \tau \arrow[d, mapsto] \arrow[r, mapsto] & \tau_{R \wedge A}(\iota_A) \arrow[d, mapsto]
						\\ \Nat((-)\{A \}, \Psi) \arrow[r] & \Psi(R \wedge A) & \alpha \circ \tau \arrow[r, mapsto] & \alpha_{R \wedge A}(\tau_{R \wedge A}(\iota_A))
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				Therefore, we have a natural isomorphism
				\[ \Nat((-)\{A \}, \Phi) \cong \Phi(R \wedge A) \cong \Nat \left(\Hom_{D(R)}(R \wedge A,-), \Phi \right) \]
				natural in $\Phi$ where the last isomorphism is by Yoneda's Lemma. By the Yoneda Lemma we deduce that there is a natural isomorphism $(-)\{A \} \cong \Hom_{D(R)}(R \wedge A, -)$ as desired. (This doesn't really differ from Schwede's proof. He basically spells out the proof of this part of Yoneda's Lemma.)
			}
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proof}

	{\scriptsize \noindent Here is some intuition about how $f^{\flat}$ determines $f^{\sharp}$. Let's just focus on $f^{\sharp}_0$ (which is nice since I was surprised at first that our argument also covers $V = 0$). Our argument sort of looks at
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				& & & R(0) \wedge (\Omega^n \sh^n M)(0) \arrow[r, "\alpha_{00}"] & (\Omega^n \sh^n M)(0)
				\\ R(0) \wedge A \arrow[rr, "R(0) \wedge \iota_0 \wedge A"] & & R(0) \wedge R(0) \wedge A \arrow[ur, "R(0) \wedge f_0^{\sharp}"] \arrow[dr, "\alpha_{V0} \wedge A", swap]
				\\ & & & R(0) \wedge A \arrow[r, "f^{\#}_0", swap] & (\Omega^n \sh^n M)(0)
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		The top route is sort of the map $r \wedge a \mapsto r \cdot f^{\flat}(a)$ and the bottom route is sort of $r \wedge a \mapsto f_0^{\sharp}(r \wedge a)$. So this is the matter of using $R$-linearity and noting that $f^{\#}$ is already is already determined on the generators given by $a \in A$, so the map $f^{\flat}$ determines it. Our proof explicitly shows that these differ only up to an isomorphism.
	}

	\begin{example} \label{example: homotopy groups via Hom-sets}
		In the lecture this was done before the proof of the theorem. We deduce \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Huh. It doesn't depend on $R$? I guess $R \wedge A$ is somehow this universal in $D(R)$. For example, also $\Hom_R(R, M) \cong M$ for ordinary $R$-modules.}
		\[ \Hom_{D(R)}(R \wedge A, M) \cong M \{A \} = \colim_n {[S^n \wedge A, M_n]_*}. \]
		This might be hard to appreciate if one hasn't experienced yet how hard it is to understand morphism 'sets' of localizations. In particular, we have 
		\[ \Hom_{\SH}(\Sigma^{\infty}A, M) \cong \colim_n {[S^n \wedge A, M_n]_*}.  \]
		For \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright See also \textbf{\#10.1}.} $A = S^k$ we in particular get
		\[ \Hom_{D(R)}(R \wedge S^k, M) \cong \pi_k(M), \quad \Hom_{\SH}(\Sigma^{\infty}S^k, M) \cong \pi_k(M). \]
		In particular, using the representability of singular cohomology via Eilenberg-MacLane spaces, we obtain
		\begin{align*}
			\Hom_{\SH}(\Sigma^{\infty}A, HB \wedge S^k) &\overset{\textbf{\ref{theorem: lambda are stable equivalences}}}{\cong} \Hom_{\SH}(\Sigma^{\infty}A, \sh^k HB)
			\\ &\cong (\sh^k HB) \{A \}
			\\ &= \colim_n {[S^n \wedge A, (\sh^k HB)_n]_*}
			\\ &= \colim_n {[S^n \wedge A, HB_{n+k}]_*}
			\\ &\cong \tilde{H}^{n+k}(S^n \wedge A;B)
			\\ &\cong \tilde{H}^k(A;B)
		\end{align*}
		where we are a little sloppy here but we know how maps of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces behave, and this allows us to show that the isomorphisms are compatible with the structure maps of the colimit.

	\section{Triangulated categories}
	Our main goal is to construct a triangulation on the homotopy category of nice enough cofibration categories. This gives us back our main example $D(R)$ but also allows us to discuss some classical examples from algebra.
	\subsection{The (not that scary) definition}
	This is not to be confused with triangulations of spaces or manifolds and so on! 
	\medskip \\Let $\Tc$ be a category equipped with an automorphism $\tb{\Sigma} : \Tc \to \Tc$. 
	\marginpar{\tiny \raggedright This prompted  me to switch to the notation $\Top$ for spaces! (I was writing $\Tc$ before because Schwede did so.)}
	A \textbf{\tb{triangle}} in $\Tc$ is a triple $(f,g,h)$ of composable morphisms with $\operatorname{target}(h) = \Sigma \operatorname{domain}(f)$. 
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			& & & & & B \arrow[dr, "g"]
			\\ A \arrow[r, "f"] & B \arrow[r, "g"] & C \arrow[r, "h"] & \Sigma A & A \arrow[ur, "f"] & & C \arrow[ll, "h"]
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	A \textbf{\tb{morphism of triangles}} $(f,g,h) \to (f', g', h')$ is a triple of morphisms 
	\[ a:A \to A', \ b : B \to B', \ c:C \to C' \]
	such that the diagram
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			A \arrow[r, "f"] \arrow[d, "a"] & B \arrow[d, "b"] \arrow[r, "g"] & C \arrow[r, "h"] \arrow[d, "c"] & \Sigma A \arrow[d, "\Sigma a"]
			\\ A' \arrow[r, "f'", swap] & B' \arrow[r, "g'", swap] & C' \arrow[r, "h'", swap] & \Sigma A'.
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	commutes.
	\begin{definition}
		A \textbf{\tb{triangulated category}} consists of an additive category $\Tc$, an autoequivalence $\Sigma : \Tc \to \Tc$ and a class of \textbf{\tb{distinguished/exact triangles}} that satisfy the following axioms: \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright This is a little weaker than Verdier's first definition. We will show that they are equivalent to some which seem to be stronger. Oxymoron much?}
		\begin{enumerate}[(T1)]
			\setcounter{enumi}{-1}
			\item The class of distinguished triangles is closed under isomorphisms.
			\item Every morphism $f$ occurs in a distinguished triangle $(f,g,h)$.
			\item For every object $X$ the triple $(0, \id_X, 0)$ is distinguished. \marginpar{\tiny Note that there is a slight abuse of notation here.}

				\begin{tikzcd}
					0 \arrow[r] & X \arrow[r, "\id_X"] & X \arrow[r] & 0

			\end{center}
			\item Rotation axiom: If $(f,g,h)$ is a distinguished triangle \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Apparently, we only get few examples without the $-$. For example, $\SH$ would not be an example.}, then $(g,h,-\Sigma f)$ is distinguished as well.
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					B \arrow[r, "g"] & C \arrow[r, "h"] & \Sigma A \arrow[r, "-\Sigma f"] & \Sigma B

			\item Completion \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Cones in triangulated categories are not functorial} of triangles: Given maps between objects of two distinguished triangles
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					A \arrow[r, "f"] \arrow[d, "a"] & B \arrow[d, "b"] \arrow[r, "g"] & C \arrow[r, "h"] \arrow[d, "\exists c", dashed] & \Sigma A \arrow[d, "\Sigma a"]
					\\ A' \arrow[r, "f'", swap] & B' \arrow[r, "g'", swap] & C' \arrow[r, "h'", swap] & \Sigma A'
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			such that $b \circ f = f' \circ a$ we \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Note that the right rectangle a priori need not commute!} can fill in the dashed arrow to obtain a morphism of triangles.
			\item Octahedral axiom: \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright OK, the Octrahedral axiom looks so much better in Gustavo's notes. \\Actually, this one is not bad. It comes about by naively starting to draw all possible triangles. Gustavo's only looks better aesthetically.} For every composable pair of morphisms $f:A \to B$ and $f':B \to D$ there is a commutative diagram
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					A \arrow[r, "f"] \arrow[d, equal] & B \arrow[d, "f'"] \arrow[r, "g"] & C \arrow[d, "x"] \arrow[r, "h"] & \Sigma A \arrow[d, equal]
					\\ A \arrow[r, "f'f"] & D \arrow[d, "g''"] \arrow[r, "g'"] & E \arrow[d, "y"] \arrow[r, "h''"] & \Sigma A \arrow[d, "\Sigma f"]
					\\ & F \arrow[d, "h'"] \arrow[r, equal] & F \arrow[r, "h'"] \arrow[d, "(\Sigma g) \circ h'"] & \Sigma B
					\\ & \Sigma B \arrow[r, "\Sigma g"] & \Sigma C
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			such that the two long rows and the two long columns are distinguished.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{definition}
	\noindent The name octahedral axiom stems from the fact that the diagram looks like an octahedron if drawn differently. Schwede says that this axiom is pretty hard to motivate other than saying that it is useful. He will probably show us something the next lectures which looks like the usual motivation being Noether's third isomorphism theorem.
	\medskip \\Algebraists sometimes assume that $\Sigma$ is an automorphism instead of just an autoequivalence and would denote it by $[1]$. This is because the main example for algebraists are the chain complexes with the shift functor $[1]$ which is an automorphism. On the other hand, topologists care about the suspension $\Sigma$ which is really just an autoequivalence and not an automorphism. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter: There is a $2$-category $\Cat$ and we really only care about the equivalences in the end. 
	\medskip \\This is probably the weakest formulation of triangulated categories. Historically, the definition of triangulated categories came up almost simultaneously in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology historically. Grothendieck was interested in algebraic geometric features which sparked ideas for triangulated categories while topologists were interested in stable homotopy theory. Puppe gave axioms which were slightly weaker than Verdier's, as he omits the infamous Octahedron Axiom. But Schwede is not even sure whether people have constructed examples which only satisfy Puppe's but not Verdier's axiom up to this day. 
	\medskip \\The \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Of course, Schwede had to mention this: One classical example appears to be a paper of his. At least I've read about this remark somewhere and there the author gave a reference of Schwede's paper.} obligatory $\infty$-remark: It's pretty hard to construct triangulated categories that don't come from stable $\infty$-categories. It's possible but basically all naturally occuring triangulated structures come from stable $\infty$-categories.
	
	\subsection{Distinguished triangles of nice homotopy categories of cofibration categories}
	
	There \marginpar{\footnotesize{\textsc{Lecture 15} \\ 13.06.2022}} is a natural way of construction a triangulation on $\Ho(\Ccat)$ if $\Ccat$ is nice enough and that is what we're working towards in this subsection.
	
	\begin{definition}
		Let $\Ccat$ be a pointed cofibration category. A \textbf{\tb{functorial cone}} is a functor $C: \Ccat \to \Ccat$ and a natural transformation $\iota:\id_{\Ccat} \to C$ such that for all $X \in \Ccat$ the map $\iota_X:X \to CX$ is cofibration and the unique morphism $CX \to *$ is a weak equivalence. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright So the cone is weakly contractible.}
	\end{definition}

	\noindent The point is the functoriality. We only demand this here to save some time, it would turn out that the functoriality is automatically given on homotopy categories. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright One could always factor $X \to *$ by the axioms of cofibration categories.}
	
	\begin{example}
		Let $\Ccat = {}_R \Mod$ for an orthogonal ring spectrum $R$. Then, we can take
		\[ CM = M \wedge [0,1], \ \iota = - \wedge 1 : M \to M \wedge [0,1]. \]
	\end{example}

	\begin{construction}
		Let $\Ccat$ be a pointed  cofibration category with functorial cone. The \textbf{\tb{suspension functor}} $\tb{\Sigma} : \Ccat \to \Ccat$ is defined \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Pointed categories are categories with zero objects.} by $\Sigma X = CX/X$ which is the pushout
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				X \arrow[r, "0"] \arrow[d, rightarrowtail, "\iota_X", swap] & * \arrow[d]
				\\ CX \arrow[r, "q_X", swap] & \Sigma X.
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
	\end{construction}

	\begin{remark}
		Some first remarks:
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item Since $C$ is functorial and pushouts are functorial, also $\Sigma$ is functorial.
			\item Any morphism $CX \to CY$ is a weak equivalence by 2-out-of-3 because both are weakly equivalent to $*$. 
			\item Given a weak equivalence $f:X \to Y$ the Gluing Lemma (\textbf{\ref{prop: gluing lemma}}) for
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					CX \arrow[d, "Cf", swap] & X \arrow[l, "\iota_X", rightarrowtail, swap] \arrow[r] \arrow[d, "f"] & * \arrow[d, equal]
					\\ CY & Y \arrow[l, rightarrowtail, "\iota_Y"] \arrow[r] & *
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			shows that $\Sigma f : \Sigma X \to \Sigma Y$ is a weak equivalence.
			\item Suppose that $C':\Ccat \to \Ccat$ is another functorial cone. Then, by the Gluing Lemma (\textbf{\ref{prop: gluing lemma}}), the following two morphisms are natural weak equivalences \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright So different choices of cones yield suspensions which differ by a zig-zag/span of weak equivalences.}
			\[ \Sigma X \xleftarrow{q_X \cup 0} CX \cup_X C'X \xrightarrow{0 \cup q'_X} \Sigma'X. \]
			{\scriptsize For the left map the Gluing Lemma is applied to
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						CX \arrow[d, equal] & X \arrow[l] \arrow[d, equal] \arrow[r] & C'X \arrow[d, "\approx"]
						\\ CX & X \arrow[l] \arrow[r] & *
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				and the right map is done the same way by symmetry.
			}
			\item The composite $\gamma \circ \Sigma : \Ccat \to \Ho(\Ccat)$ takes weak equivalences to isomorphisms since $\Sigma$ preserves weak equivalences by (iii). So the universal property of localization yields a unique functor $\Sigma : \Ho(\Ccat) \to \Ho(\Ccat)$ such that
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\Ccat \arrow[r, "\Sigma"] \arrow[d, "\gamma", swap] & \Ccat \arrow[d, "\gamma"]
					\\ \Ho(\Ccat) \arrow[r, "\Sigma", swap, dashed] & \Ho(\Ccat)
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			In particular, $\Sigma X = \Sigma X$ on objects (after abuse of notation), \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright So we mean the two different $\Sigma$'s appearing above.} and
			\[ \Sigma( \gamma(s)^{-1} \circ \gamma(f)) = (\Sigma \gamma(s))^{-1} \circ (\Sigma \gamma(f)) = \gamma(\Sigma s)^{-1} \circ \gamma(\Sigma f). \]
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{remark} 

	\noindent In the following, we will not use everything in the structure of triangulated categories. Secretly, pre-triangulated/unstable triangulated categories are dwelling behind the scenes.

	\begin{construction}
		Let $\Ccat$ be a pointed cofibration category with functorial cone. The \textbf{\tb{elementary distinguished triangle}} of a $\Ccat$-morphism $\psi:X \to Y$ is
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				X \arrow[r, "\gamma(\psi)"] & Y \arrow[r, "\gamma(i)"] & C \psi \arrow[r, "\gamma(p)"] & \Sigma X
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		Here, $C\psi$ is the \textbf{\tb{mapping cone}} of $\psi$, i.e. a pushout
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				X \arrow[r, "\psi"] \arrow[d, "\iota_X", swap] & Y \arrow[d, "i"]
				\\ CX \arrow[r] & C\psi.
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		The universal property of the pushout yields a morphism
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				X \arrow[r, "\psi"] \arrow[d, "\iota_X", swap] & Y \arrow[d, "i"] \arrow[ddr, "0", bend left]
				\\ CX \arrow[r] \arrow[rrd, "q_X", swap, bend right] & C\psi \arrow[dr, "p = q_X \cup 0", dashed, swap]
				\\ & & \Sigma X
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		These maps really give a cocone by the definition of $q_X$.
		\medskip \\A triangle $(f,g,h)$ in $\Ho(\Ccat)$ is \textbf{\tb{distinguished}} if it is isomorphic (in $\Ho(\Ccat)$) to some elementary distinguished triangle, i.e. if there is a $\Ccat$-morphism $\psi:X \to Y$ along with isomorphisms $a:A \xrightarrow{\sim} X, \ b : B \xrightarrow{\sim} Y, \ c : C \xrightarrow{\sim} C \psi$ in $\Ho(\Ccat)$ such that the following diagram commutes:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				A \arrow[r, "f"] \arrow[d, "a"] & B \arrow[r, "g"] \arrow[d, "b"] & C \arrow[r, "h"] \arrow[d, "c"] & \Sigma A \arrow[d, "\Sigma a"]
				\\ X \arrow[r, "\gamma(\psi)", swap] & Y \arrow[r, "\gamma(i)", swap] & C \psi \arrow[r, "\gamma(p)", swap] & \Sigma X
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
	\end{construction}

	\begin{construction}[Distinguished triangles from cofibrations]
		Let $j:A \rightarrowtail B$ be a cofibration in $\Ccat$. Write $\tb{B/A} = \coker{j}$ and $q:B \to B/A$ by the quotient morphism.
		{\scriptsize \medskip \\ Let me draw two diagrams.
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					A \arrow[r, "j"] \arrow[d, "0", swap] & B \arrow[d, "q"] & A \arrow[r, shift left, "j"] \arrow[r, shift right, "0", swap] & B \arrow[r] & B/A
					\\ * \arrow[r] & B/A
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
		}
		\noindent The Gluing Lemma (\textbf{\ref{prop: gluing lemma}}) for
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				CA \arrow[d, "{0, \approx}", swap] & A \arrow[l, "\iota_A", swap, rightarrowtail] \arrow[r, rightarrowtail, "j"] \arrow[d, equal] & B \arrow[d, equal]
				\\ * & A \arrow[l, "0"] \arrow[r, rightarrowtail, "j", swap] & B
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		shows that $0 \cup \id_B : Cj \to B/A$ is also a weak equivalence. \marginpar{\tiny This is an infamous fact e.g. in Hatcher, chapter 0. We've just shown that it is abstractly true in this more general setting.} Thus, $\gamma(0 \cup \id_B)$ is invertible in $\Ho(\Ccat)$.
		\medskip \\We define the \textbf{\tb{connecting morphism}} in $\Ho(\Ccat)$ as
		\[ \tb{\delta(j)} = \gamma(p) \circ \gamma(0 \cup \id_B)^{-1} : B/A \to \Sigma A. \]
		More suggestively, we write \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Somehow, the notation confuses me. Even though we write $\id_B$, there is still the identification by $A$ afterwards. I guess this is maybe one reason that one shouldn't always think of the cofiber $B/A = B \amalg_A *$ as a quotient.}
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				B/A & & Cj \arrow[ll, "0 \cup \id_B", swap] \arrow[rr, "p = q_A \cup 0"] & & \Sigma A.
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		Here's a suggestive picture:
		\begin{figure}[H]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth, angle = 90]{ConnectingHomTriangulated}
			\caption{Also probably identify some basepoint-line.}
		\end{figure}
		\noindent The following commutes by construction in $\Ho(\Ccat)$:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				A \arrow[r, "\gamma(j)"] \arrow[d, equal] & B \arrow[d, equal] \arrow[r, "\gamma(i)"] & Cj \arrow[d, "\gamma(0 \cup \id_B)"] \arrow[r, "\gamma(p)"] & \Sigma A \arrow[d, equal]
				\\ A \arrow[r, "\gamma(j)", swap] & B \arrow[r, "\gamma(q)", swap] & B/A \arrow[r, "\delta(j)", swap] & \Sigma A
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		The middle square \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Pictorially: The top-right composition embeds $B$ in $Cj$ and then collapses the $A$-part. The bottom map immediately collapses the $A$-part.} commutes because both compositions are the universal map $B \to B/A$ of the pushout $B/A = B \amalg_A *$. Therefore, $(\gamma(j), \gamma(q), \delta(j))$ is distinguished.
	\end{construction}

	\noindent All in all, we have two viewpoints of distinguished triangles in $\Ho(\Ccat)$. We can view them via elementary distinguished triangles through a cone or we can view them via cofibrations.
	
	\begin{proposition}
		Let $\Ccat$ be a pointed cofibration category with functorial cone. Then, a triangle is distinguished if and only if it is isomorphic to $(\gamma(j), \gamma(q), \delta(j))$ for some cofibration $j$ in $\Ccat$.
	\end{proposition}

	\begin{proof}
		We've just seen that these triangles formed with cofibrations are distinguished. Conversely, let $\psi:X \to Y$ be any morphism. We must show that the elementary distinguished triangle $(\gamma(\psi), \gamma(i), \gamma(p))$ is isomorphic to some $(\gamma(j), \gamma(q), \delta(j))$ for some cofibration $j$. For this, we choose a factorization
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				X \arrow[rr, "\psi"] \arrow[rd, "j", rightarrowtail, swap] & & Y
				\\ & Z \arrow[ur, "{\pi, \approx}", swap]
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		All vertical morphisms in the following commutative diagram are weak equivalences:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				X \arrow[r, rightarrowtail, "j"] \arrow[d, equal] & Z \arrow[d, equal] \arrow[r, "q"] & Z/X
				\\ X \arrow[d, equal] \arrow[r, rightarrowtail, "j"] & Z \arrow[d, "{\pi}"] \arrow[r, "i_j"] & Cj \arrow[u, "0 \cup \id_Z", swap] \arrow[d, "{\id_{CX} \cup \pi}"] \arrow[r, "p_j"] & \Sigma X \arrow[d, equal]
				\\ X \arrow[r, "\psi", swap] & Y \arrow[r, "i_{\psi}", swap] & C \psi \arrow[r, "p \psi", swap] & \Sigma X
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		Applying the localization functor yields a commutative diagram in the homotopy category:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				X \arrow[r, "\gamma(j)"] \arrow[d, equal] & Z \arrow[d, "\gamma(\pi)"] \arrow[r, "\gamma(q)"] & Z/X \arrow[rr, "\delta(j)"] \arrow[d, "\gamma(\id \cup \pi) \circ \gamma(0 \cup \id_Z)^{-1}"] & & \Sigma X \arrow[d, equal]
				\\ X \arrow[r, "\gamma(\psi)", swap] & Y \arrow[r, "\gamma(i_{\psi})", swap] & C \psi \arrow[rr, "\gamma(p_{\psi})", swap] & & \Sigma X.
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
	\end{proof}

	\noindent Functoriality in the functorial cone and additivity of $\Ho(\Ccat)$ in the following result are redundant. One gets some sort of functoriality on $\Ho(\Ccat)$ but this requires some more pages of work. The additivity is also automatic if $\Sigma$ is an equivalence.

	\begin{theorem}
		Let $\Ccat$ be a pointed cofibration category with functorial cone. Suppose that $\Ho(\Ccat)$ is additive and that $\Sigma : \Ho(\Ccat) \to \Ho(\Ccat)$ is an equivalence. Then, 
		\[ (\Ho(\Ccat), \Sigma, \text{distinguished triangles}) \]
		forms a triangulated cateogry.
	\end{theorem}

	\begin{proof}
		Little did I expect, soon Schwede would be torturing me...
		\begin{enumerate}[(T1)]
			\setcounter{enumi}{-1}
			\item The class of distinguished triangles is closed under isomorphisms: By construction.
			\item Every morphism $f$ in $\Ho(\Ccat)$ is part of a distinguished triangle $(f,g,h)$: We write $f:A \to B$ in $\Ho(\Ccat)$ as $f = \gamma(s)^{-1} \circ \gamma(\psi)$ for two $\Ccat$-morphisms $\psi:A \to D$ and $s:B \xrightarrow{\approx} D$. Then, the following diagram commutes in $\Ho(\Ccat)$:

The morphism $\iota_Y:Y \to CY$ is a cofibration by definition of functorial cones and $p = q_X \cup 0 : C \psi \to \Sigma X$ models the quotient of $C \psi/Y$, so the triangle $(\gamma(i), \gamma(p), \delta(i))$ is distinguished. {\scriptsize \medskip \\Consider the commutative diagram

			We start with a first claim whose sole purpose is to prove the next claim.
			\begin{quote}
				\textbf{Claim 1.} The two morphisms
				\[ q_Y \cup 0, 0 \cup q_Y : CY \cup_Y CY \to \Sigma Y \]
				are additive inverses in $\Ho(\Ccat)$.
				\begin{proof}
					The two morphisms $q_Y \cup 0, 0 \cup q_Y : CY \cup_Y CY \to \Sigma Y$ become additive inverses in $\Ho(\Ccat)$: We consider the morphism 
					\[ \xi : CY \cup_Y CY \to \Sigma Y \vee \Sigma Y \]
					which pictorially should amount to \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright I guess we see $q_Y \cup 0 = -0 \cup q_Y$ in the picture because we sort of flipped one of the cones $CY$ during the gluing process? Not completely sure but this seems to be the intuition.}
					\begin{figure}[H]
						\centering
						\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth, angle = 90]{DoubleConeIntoDoubleSuspension}
						\caption{Also probably identify some basepoint-line.}
					\end{figure}
					and formally is the morphism induced on pushouts by
					\begin{center}
						\begin{tikzcd}
							CY \vee CY \arrow[d, equal] & Y \vee Y \arrow[l, "\iota_Y \vee \iota_Y", swap] \arrow[d, equal] \arrow[r, "\nabla"] & Y \arrow[d]
							\\ CY \vee CY & Y \vee Y \arrow[l, "\iota_Y \vee \iota_Y"] \arrow[r] & *
						\end{tikzcd}
					\end{center}
					{\scriptsize Well yeah, but isn't it much more convenient to rather view it as the following?
						\begin{center}
							\begin{tikzcd}
								CY \arrow[d, "q_Y", swap] & Y \arrow[l] \arrow[d] \arrow[r] & CY \arrow[d, "q_Y"]
								\\ \Sigma Y & * \arrow[l] \arrow[r] & \Sigma Y
							\end{tikzcd}
						\end{center}
					At least I'm much more comfortable with this and the next line is also clearer. \medskip \\
					}
					So we have
					\[ (\id_{\Sigma Y} + \ 0) \circ \xi = q_Y \cup 0 \quad \text{and} \quad (0 + \id_{\Sigma Y}) \circ \xi = 0 \cup q_Y. \]
					Thus, $\gamma(\xi) = \gamma(q_Y \cup 0) \perp \gamma(0 \cup q_Y)$. The following commutes in $\Ccat$:
					\begin{center}
						\begin{tikzcd}
							CY \cup_Y CY \arrow[r, "\xi"] \arrow[d, "\id_Y \cup \id_Y", swap] & \Sigma Y \vee \Sigma Y \arrow[d, "\nabla = \id + \id"]
							\\ CY \arrow[r, "q_Y", swap] & \Sigma Y
						\end{tikzcd}
					\end{center}
					Since $CY \approx *$ we obtain
					\[ \gamma(\nabla) \circ \gamma(\xi) = \gamma(q_Y) \circ \gamma(\id_Y \cup \id_Y) = 0 \]
					in $\Ho(\Ccat)$, so
					\begin{align*}
						\gamma(0 \cup q_Y) + \gamma(q_Y \cup 0) &= \gamma(\nabla) \circ (\gamma(0 \cup q_Y) \perp \gamma(q_Y \cup 0))
						\\ &= \gamma(\nabla) \circ \gamma(\xi)
						\\ &= 0.
					\end{align*}
				\end{proof}
			\end{quote}
			\noindent This allows us to prove the following.
			\begin{quote}
				\textbf{Claim 2.} $\delta(i) = - \Sigma \gamma(\psi)$.
				
				\begin{proof}
					We let $\zeta : CY \cup_i C \psi = Ci \to CY \cup_Y CY$ be the morphism induced on pushouts given by \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{OK, I'm confused about the morphism $\zeta$.}}
					\begin{center}
						\begin{tikzcd}
							CY \vee CX \arrow[d, "\id_{CY} \vee C(\psi)", swap] & & X \vee X \arrow[d, "\psi \vee \psi"] \arrow[r, "\nabla"] \arrow[ll, "(\iota_Y \circ \psi) \vee \iota_X", swap] & X \arrow[d, "\psi"]
							\\ CY \vee CY & & Y \vee Y \arrow[ll, "\iota_Y \vee \iota_Y"] \arrow[r, "\nabla", swap] & Y
						\end{tikzcd}
					\end{center}
					Then,
					\[ (q_Y \cup 0) \circ \zeta = q_Y \cup 0 \quad \text{and} \quad (0 \cup q_Y) \circ \zeta = (\Sigma \psi) \circ (0 \cup p). \]
					Have a commutative diagram
					\begin{center}
						\begin{tikzcd}
							Y \arrow[r, "i"] & C \psi \arrow[rr, "p_{\psi} = 0 \cup q_X"] & & \Sigma X \arrow[rr, dashed, "\delta(i)"] & & \Sigma Y
							\\ & & & & CY \cup C \psi \arrow[ur, "q_Y \cup 0", swap] \arrow[ul, "{0 \cup p, \approx}"]
						\end{tikzcd}
					\end{center}
					So
					\begin{align*}
						\delta(i) &= \gamma(q_Y \cup 0) \circ \gamma(0 \cup p)^{-1}
						\\ &= \gamma(q_Y \cup 0) \circ \gamma(\zeta) \circ \gamma(0 \cup p)^{-1}
						\\ &= - \gamma(0 \cup q_Y) \circ \gamma(\zeta) \circ \gamma(0 \cup p)^{-1}
						\\ &= - (\Sigma \psi) \circ (\gamma(0 \cup p) \circ \gamma(0 \cup p)^{-1})
						\\ &= - \Sigma \psi.
					\end{align*} 
				\end{proof}
			\end{quote}
			Therefore, $(\gamma(i), \gamma(p), \delta(i)) = (\gamma(i), \gamma(p), - \Sigma \gamma(\psi))$ is distinguished as desired.
			\item Given distinguished triangles $(f,g,h), (f', g', h')$ we can complete

				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			WLOG $(f,g,h) = (\gamma(j), \gamma(q), \delta(j))$ for some cofibration $j:A \rightarrowtail B$ and also WLOG $(f', g', h') = (\gamma(j'), \gamma(q'), \delta(j'))$ for some cofibration $j': A' \rightarrowtail B'$. Have
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					A \arrow[d, "a", swap] \arrow[r, "\gamma(j)"] & B \arrow[d, "b"]
					\\ A' \arrow[r, "\gamma(j')", swap] & B'
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			and we do the special case $a = \gamma(\alpha)$ and $b = \gamma(\beta)$ for some $\Ccat$-morphism $\alpha:A \to A'$ and $\beta:B \to B'$. Because $\gamma(\beta j) = \gamma(j' \alpha)$ there is an acyclic cofibration $s:B' \overset{\approx}{\rightarrowtail} \ol{B}$, a cylinder object $(I, i_0, i_1, p)$ for $A$ and a homotopy $H:I \to \ol{B}$ from $H i_0 = s j' \alpha$ to $H i_1 = s \beta j$ by the calculus of fractions (\textbf{\ref{corollary: calculus of fractions}}). Scrutinize the diagram
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					A \arrow[d, equal] \arrow[r, rightarrowtail, "j"] & B
					\\ A \arrow[d, "\alpha", swap] \arrow[r, "i_0", rightarrowtail] & I \cup_{i_1} B = \tb{\operatorname{Zyl}(j)} \arrow[u, "{jp \cup \id_B, \approx}", swap] \arrow[d, "H \cup s \beta"]

					\\ A' \arrow[r, rightarrowtail, "j'", swap] & B' \arrow[u, rightarrowtail, "{s, \approx}", swap]
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			So also the following diagram commutes:
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					A \arrow[r, "\gamma(j)"] & B \arrow[r, "\gamma(q)"] & B/A \arrow[r, "\delta(j)"] & \Sigma A

					\\ A' \arrow[r, "\gamma(sj')", swap] & \ol{B} \arrow[r, "\gamma(\ol{q})", swap] & \ol{B}/A' \arrow[r, "\delta(sj')", swap] & \Sigma A'

				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			Have $\gamma(s)^{-1} \circ \gamma(H \cup s \beta) \circ \gamma(jp \cup \beta)^{-1} = b$ and 
			\[ C = \gamma(s/A')^{-1} \circ \gamma((H \cup s \beta)/\alpha) \circ \gamma(jp \cup B/A)^{-1} \]

Then, $f' \circ f = \gamma(j' \circ j)$ where $j' \circ j : A \rightarrowtail D$ is another cofibration. So there is a diagram in $\Ccat$

			Now \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Essentially the octahedral axiom amounts to $(D/A)/(B/A) \cong D/B$ for $A \subseteq B \subseteq D$. This is displayed precisely in the top diagram if one thinks of the third term of a distinguished triangle as a cokernel!} onto the general case. Let $f = \gamma(s)^{-1} \circ \gamma(a)$ for a $\Ccat$-morphism $a:A \to B'$ and a weak equivalence $s:B \xrightarrow{\approx} B'$ by the calculus of fractions (\textbf{\ref{corollary: calculus of fractions}}). We factor $a = pj$ for a cofibration $j:A \rightarrowtail \ol{B}$ and a weak equivalence $p: \ol{B} \xrightarrow{\approx} B'$. Then, $f = \phi \circ \gamma(j)$ where $\phi = \gamma(s)^{-1} \circ \gamma(p)$ is an isomorphism. We apply the same reasoning to $f' \circ \phi : \ol{B} \to D$ as $f' \circ \phi = \psi \circ \gamma(j')$ for some cofibration $j': \ol{B} \rightarrowtail \ol{D}$ and an isomorphism $\psi$. Then, $j$ and $j'$ are composable cofibrations in $\Ccat$, so we get the claimed data for $\gamma(j)$ and $\gamma(j')$ by the special case. Since $f$ and $f'$ differ from $\gamma(j)$ and $\gamma(j')$ by isomorphisms, we complete the data from the special case to get the data for $f$ and $f'$.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proof}

	\subsection{Classical examples of triangulated categories}
	
	We start with the main example of this course and then proceed with some rather algebraic ones to give the context of classical triangulated categories.

	\begin{example}
		Let $R$ be an orthogonal ring spectrum (e.g. $R = \S$\footnote{So in particular this example includes ${}_{\S}\Mod \simeq \Sp$ (which is a Quillen equivalence).}). A functorial cone on ${}_R \Mod$ is given by $M \wedge [0,1]$ and $\iota_M = - \wedge 1 : M \rightarrowtail M \wedge [0,1]$. A cokernel of $\iota_M$ is the morphism $M \wedge t : M \wedge [0,1] \to M \wedge S^1$ for $M \in {}_R \Mod$. 
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				M \arrow[r] \arrow[d, "- \wedge 1", swap] & * \arrow[d]
				\\ M \wedge [0,1] \arrow[r, "M \wedge t", swap] & M \wedge S^1
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}So for this choice of functorial cone and cokernel, we obtain $\Sigma M = M \wedge S^1$. Therefore, $D(R)$ is triangulated \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Note that $\Sigma$ is an autoequivalence with quasi-inverse $\Omega$ by \textbf{\ref{theorem: loop, suspension}}.} with the suspension functor $- \wedge S^1$ and distinguished triangles isomorphic to
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				M \arrow[r, "\gamma(\psi)"] & N \arrow[r, "\gamma(i)"] & (M \wedge [0,1]) \cup_{\psi} N \arrow[r, "\gamma(p)"] & M \wedge S^1
				\\ & & \tb{C \psi} \arrow[u, equal]
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
	\end{example}

	\begin{example}
		Let $\Ac$ be an additive category and $\Ch(\Ac)$ be the category of $\Z$-graded chain complexes in $\Ac$. Then, $\tb{K(\Ac)}$ is the \textbf{\tb{homotopy category}} of $\Ac$ given by
		\[ \Ob(K(\Ac)) = \Ob(\Ch(\Ac)), \quad \Hom(C_{\bullet}, D_{\bullet}) = \Hom_{\Ch(\Ac)}(C_{\bullet}, D_{\bullet})/(\text{chain homotopy}). \]
		In \textbf{\#7.1} we shows that $\Ch(\Ac) \to K(\Ac)$ is a localization at the class of chain homotopy equivalences. Moreover, $K(\Ac)$ is additive. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{How much work is it to show that $K(\Ac)$ is additive? I guess this is essentially due to the above construction making the group structure apparent? But I don't think the coproduct-product part is clear.}}
		\medskip \\Recall that the \textbf{\tb{cone}} of a complex $A_{\bullet} \in \Ch(\Ac)$ is the complex $\tb{CA_{\bullet}}$ given by $(CA_{\bullet})_n = A_n \oplus A_{n-1}$ with differential
		\begin{align*}
			d_n^{CA_{\bullet}} : (CA_{\bullet})_n = A_n \oplus A_{n-1} &\to A_{n-1} \oplus A_{n-2} = (CA_{\bullet})_{n-1}
			\\ (a_n, a_{n-1}) &\mapsto \left(d_n^{A_{\bullet}}(a_n) + (-1)^n a_{n-1}, \ d_{n-1}^{A_{\bullet}}(a_{n-1}) \right)
		\end{align*}
		Moreover, $\iota_{A_{\bullet}} : A_{\bullet} \to CA_{\bullet}$ is the inclusion of the first summand. Then, $CA$ is chain contractible, and $A_{\bullet} \to CA_{\bullet}$ is a cofibration where a chain map $f:A_{\bullet} \to B_{\bullet}$ is a \textbf{\tb{cofibration}} if there \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Note that ${}_R \Mod$ is idempotent complete, so dimensionwise split monomorphisms was OK there in \textbf{\#6.2}.} are objects $C_n$ for $n \in \Z$ and isomorphisms $A_n \oplus C_n \xrightarrow{\sim} B_n$ that restrict to $f_n:A_n \to B_n$. These cofibrations and the chain homotopy equivalences form a cofibration structure on $\Ch(\Ac)$.
		\medskip \\The \textbf{\tb{shift}} $\tb{A_{\bullet}[1]}$ of $A_{\bullet} \in \Ch(\Ac)$ is given by $(A_{\bullet}[1])_n = A_{n+1}$ with reindexed differential. The projection to the second summand $CA_{\bullet} \to A[1]$ exhibits $A_{\bullet}[1]$ as a cokernel of $\iota_{A_{\bullet}} : A_{\bullet} \to CA_{\bullet}$, so $\Sigma A_{\bullet} = A_{\bullet}[1]$. Then, $\Sigma$ is invertible with inverse $[-1]$.
	\end{example}

	\begin{corollary}
		For an additive category $\Ac$, its homotopy category $K(\Ac)$ is a triangulated category with respect to the shift functor and the triangles that are isomorphic to
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				A_{\bullet} \arrow[r, "\gamma(\psi)"] & B_{\bullet} \arrow[r, "\gamma(i)"] & C\psi \arrow[r, "\gamma(p)"] & A_{\bullet}[1].
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		where $(C \psi)_n = B_n \oplus A_{n-1}$. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright ...with the correct differential which is obnoxiously annoying to remember.}
	\end{corollary}

	\noindent We needed very little to form $K(\Ac)$ and obtain a triangulated structure!
	
	\begin{example}
		Let $\Ac$ be an abelian category (e.g. $\Ac = {}_S \Mod$ for a ring $S$). There is another cofibration structure on $\Ch(\Ac)$ with the same cofibrations and the quasi-isomorphisms as weak equivalences. Let $\gamma: \Ch(\Ac) \to D(\Ac)$ be a localization at the class of quasi-isomorphisms. The target $\tb{D(\Ac)}$ is called the \textbf{\tb{derived category}} of $\Ac$.
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				\Ch(\Ac) \arrow[r] \arrow[rd, "\gamma", swap] & K(\Ac) \arrow[d, "\exists ! \ol{\gamma}", dashed]
				\\ & D(\Ac)
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		By general abstract nonsense, $\ol{\gamma}$ is a localization. 
		{\scriptsize \medskip \\I believe I've seen this argument in Gustavo's course before. Anyhow, it's not too heavy. We consider a test morphism $\phi : K(\Ac) \to T$ which inverts quasi-isomorphisms.
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\Ch(\Ac) \arrow[r, "\gamma'"] \arrow[dr, "\gamma", swap] & K(\Ac) \arrow[d, "\ol{\gamma}"] \arrow[r, "\phi"] & T 
					\\ & D(\Ac) \arrow[ur, "\ol{\ol{\gamma}}", dashed, swap]
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
		So $\phi \gamma'$ also inverts quasi-isomorphisms and hence the universal property of $\gamma$ yields a unique map $\ol{\ol{\gamma}}$ with $\ol{\ol{\gamma}} \gamma = \phi \gamma'$. Thus,
		\[ \ol{\ol{\gamma}} \ol{\gamma} \gamma' = \ol{\ol{\gamma}} \gamma = \phi \gamma' \]
		which shows $\ol{\ol{\gamma}} \ol{\gamma} = \phi$ by the uniqueness of the universal property of $\gamma'$. So we see existence for $\ol{\gamma}$. Moreover, any $\ol{\ol{\gamma}}$ satisfying $\ol{\ol{\gamma}} \ol{\gamma} = \phi$ also satisfies
		\[ \ol{\ol{\gamma}} \gamma = \ol{\ol{\gamma}} \ol{\gamma} \gamma' = \phi \gamma' \]
		and such $\ol{\ol{\gamma}}$ are unique by the uniqueness of the universal property of $\gamma$. So we get uniqueness.
		\medskip \\
		} Classically, one shows that $D(\Ac)$ comes from a localization of $K(\Ac)$ in the above fashion but if you know about cofibration categories, then this intermediate step is not necessary.
	\end{example}

	\begin{corollary}
		For an abelian category $\Ac$, its derived category $D(\Ac)$ is triangulated with shift as the suspension functor and distinguished triangles the images of the distinguished triangles in $K(\Ac)$.
	\end{corollary}

	\begin{theorem}
		For every ring $S$ there is an equivalence of triangulated categories
		\[ D({}_S \Mod) \simeq D(HS). \]
	\end{theorem}

	\begin{proof}
		Proof would take too long. In the classical literature the proof considers a number of Quillen equivalences.
	\end{proof}

	\noindent Here, we see how algebra enters homotopy theory (or vice versa).
	\subsection{More abstract nonsense facts}
	In Verdier's exposition as in many others\footnote{E.g. in Gustavo's dg-category course from SoSe 2021.}, part (iii) of the following proposition is already given as an axiom but it is redundant. Algebraists don't gain much by not presuming it since their suspension is an automorphism but for topologists it isn't immediate.
	
	\begin{proposition} \label{prop: more abstract nonsense triangulated categories}
		Let $\Tc$ be a triangulated category.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item For every distinguished triangle $(f,g,h)$ and all $\Tc$-objects $X$, the following sequences are exact:
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\Tc(\Sigma A, X) \arrow[r, "{\Tc(h, X)}"] & \Tc(C,X) \arrow[r, "{\Tc(g, X)}"] & \Tc(B, X) \arrow[r, "{\Tc(f, X)}"] & \Tc(A,X),
					\\ \Tc(X, A) \arrow[r, "{\Tc(X, f)}"] & \Tc(X, B) \arrow[r, "{\Tc(X, g)}"] & \Tc(X, C) \arrow[r, "{\Tc(X, h)}"] & \Tc(X, \Sigma A).
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			\item Let $(a,b,c)$ be a morphism between distinguished triangles. If two of $a,b,c$ are isomorphisms, then so is the third.
			\item Let $(f,g,h)$ be a triangle such that $(g,h,- \Sigma f)$ is distinguished, then $(f,g,h)$ is distinguished.
			\item Let $(f_1, g_1, h_1), (f_2, g_2, h_2)$ and $(f_3, g_3, h_3)$ be distinguished triangles with composable $f$'s, i.e. $f_3 = f_2 \circ f_1$. Then, there are morphisms $\ol{x}, \ol{y}$ such that $(\ol{x}, \ol{y}, (\Sigma g_1) \circ h_2)$ is distinguished, and the following commutes: \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Cones are not functorial in triangluated categories.

			\item If $(f,g,h)$ is distinguished \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Can also choose a retraction and express $B$ as a product.} and $s:C \to B$ is such that $gs = \id_C$, then the morphism $f:A \to B$ and $s:C \to B$ exhibit $B$ as a coproduct of $A$ and $C$, i.e. $B = A \oplus B$.
			\item Let $I$ be a set and $\{(f_i, g_i, h_i) \}_{i \in I}$ be a family of distinguished triangles, then the following triangles are also distinguished:

					\bigoplus_{i \in I} A_i \arrow[r, "\bigoplus_{i \in I} f_i"] & \bigoplus_{i \in I} B_i \arrow[r, "\bigoplus_{i \in I} g_i"] & \bigoplus_{i \in I} C_i \arrow[rr, "\can \circ  \bigoplus_{i \in I} h_i "] & & \Sigma \left( \bigoplus_{i \in I} A_i \right),

			\item If $A \oplus B$ is a coproduct \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright A kind of converse to (vi).} of $A,B$ in $\Tc$ with universal morphisms $i_A:A \to A \oplus B$ and $i_B : B \to A \oplus B$, then the following triangle is distinguished
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					A \arrow[r, "i_A"] & A \oplus B \arrow[r, "p_B"] & B \arrow[r, "0"] & \Sigma A
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			where $p_B$ is characterized by $p_B i_A = 0$ and $p_B i_B = \id_B$.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proposition}

	\begin{proof}
		We will not prove everything.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item Suppose that $(f,g,h)$ is distinguished.
			\begin{quote}
				\textbf{Claim.} For distinguished triangles $(f,g,h)$ we have $gf = 0$.
				
				\begin{proof}
					Consider the following diagram.
					\begin{center}
						\begin{tikzcd}
							A \arrow[r, equal] \arrow[d, equal] & A \arrow[r] \arrow[d, "f"] & 0 \arrow[r] \arrow[d, dashed, "\exists"] & \Sigma A \arrow[d, equal]
							\\ A \arrow[r, "f", swap] & B \arrow[r, "g", swap] & C \arrow[r, "h", swap] & \Sigma A
						\end{tikzcd}
					\end{center}
					The upper triangle is distinguished by (T2) and the dashed arrow exists by (T4). Thus, $gf$ factors through $0$.
				\end{proof}
			\end{quote}
			Let us now check exactness. We only check exactness at $\Tc(B, X)$, as the remaining exactness conditions come from rotating. 
			\medskip \\The condition $gf = 0$ implies $f^* \circ g^* = (gf)^* = 0$. Now let $\psi : B \to X$ be in $\ker{f^*}$, i.e. $\psi \circ f = 0 : A \to X$. We apply (T4) to
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						A \arrow[r, "f"] \arrow[d] & B \arrow[d, "\psi"] \arrow[r, "g"] & C \arrow[r, "h"] \arrow[d, "\phi", dashed] & \Sigma A \arrow[d]
						\\ 0 \arrow[r] & X \arrow[r, equal] & X \arrow[r] & 0
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
			Then, $\psi = \phi g = g^* \phi$, so $\psi \in \im(g^*)$.
			\item Allude to the Five Lemma.
			\item Suppose that $(g,h,-\Sigma f)$ is distinguished. Rotating twice (T3), also $(- \Sigma f, - \Sigma g, - \Sigma h)$ is distinguished. We choose a distinguished triangle $(f, \ol{g}, \ol{h})$ that starts with $f$. Then, the triangle $(- \Sigma f, - \Sigma \ol{g}, - \Sigma \ol{h})$ is distinguished. Consider the diagram
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\Sigma A \arrow[r, "- \Sigma f"] \arrow[d, equal] & \Sigma B \arrow[d, equal] \arrow[r, "- \Sigma g"] & \Sigma C \arrow[r, "- \Sigma h"] \arrow[d, "\ol{c}", dashed] & \Sigma^2 C \arrow[d, equal]
					\\ \Sigma A \arrow[r, "\Sigma f", swap] & \Sigma B \arrow[r, "- \Sigma \ol{g}", swap] & \Sigma \ol{C} \arrow[r, "- \Sigma \ol{h}", swap] & \Sigma^2 A
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			There is an isomorphism $\ol{c} : \Sigma C \to \Sigma \ol{C}$ that makes the above commute by (T4) and the Five Lemma (ii). Because $\Sigma$ is fully faithful, there is a unique isomorphism $c:C \to \ol{C}$ such that $\Sigma c = \ol{c}$. Then, also
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					A \arrow[r, "f"] \arrow[d, equal] & B \arrow[r, "g"] \arrow[d, equal] & C \arrow[r, "h"] \arrow[d, "c"] & \Sigma A \arrow[d, equal]
					\\ A \arrow[r, "f", swap] & B \arrow[r, "\ol{g}", swap] & \ol{C} \arrow[r, "\ol{h}", swap] & \Sigma A
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			so $(f,g,h)$ is isomorphic to a distinguished triangle, so it itself is distinguished.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proof}

	{\scriptsize \noindent I believe (i) now \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{Does a dual argument work for homotopy fibers? There are triangles for the strict fiber given a fibration (\textbf{\#9.4}) but are there distinguished triangles for homotopy fibers analogous to the elementary distinguished triangles?}} gives another justification for our LES's and also gives more context on our weird rotation argument. Indeed, in $\SH$ we consider a triangle $X \xrightarrow{f} Y \to Cf \to \Sigma X$, then we obtain an exact sequence
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				\SH(\Sigma^{\infty}S^k, X) \arrow[r] \arrow[d, "\wr"] & \SH(\Sigma^{\infty} S^k, Y) \arrow[d, "\wr"] \arrow[r] & \SH(\Sigma^{\infty} S^k, Cf) \arrow[d, "\wr"] \arrow[r] & \SH(\Sigma^{\infty} S^k, \Sigma X) \arrow[d, "\wr"]
				\\ \pi_k(X) \arrow[r] & \pi_k(Y) \arrow[r] & \pi_k(Cf) \arrow[r] & \pi_k(\Sigma X) \cong \pi_{k-1}(X).
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		where we use \textbf{\ref{example: homotopy groups via Hom-sets}}. The rotation argument in the proof of the mapping cone LES (\textbf{\ref{prop: mapping cone LES}}) probably amounts to showing that totating an elementary distinguished triangle indeed yields another distinguished triangle, as predicted by (T3).
		\medskip \\Unfortunately, there is one problem in this argument. We are using the LES in our proof of the cofibration structure on $\SH$ to show that acyclic cofibrations are preserved by cobase change. This seems hard to go around. But at the very least this does show us how our LES's are connected to the triangulated structures. \medskip \\

	Time is running out, we've dealt with a lot of formal stuff but haven't actually managed any meaningful computation yet. On the other hand, we only have three weeks left. (Oh boy, time is flying.) So we start by omitting the remaining parts of the above proof trusting in the mathematical sophistication of master's students. 
	
	\section{Thom's Theorem}
	We are \marginpar{\footnotesize{\textsc{Lecture 17} \\ 20.06.2022}} facing the usual problem: Time is running out too quickly! We only have three weeks left. Schwede had planned to cover a lot, for instance he wanted to discuss the smash product on $D(R)$ which is one of the reasons for the abstract nonsense treatment of the last bunch of lectures. On the other hand, this would surely take two out of the three weeks and then we would not have computed anything substantial in the entire course. That's why smash products will be delegated to next semester where we will encounter the equivariant version. 
	\medskip \\From here on out, Schwede was deciding between two topics that he could cover. Either he would compute some low-dimensional homotopy groups with Adams Spectral Sequence, or he would discuss Thom's Theorem with the $\MO$-spectrum along with some bordism theory. He decided to do the latter.
	\medskip \\Our goals in this section:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We eventually want to prove a natural isomorphism of homology theories
		\[ \MO_*(X) = \pi_*(\MO \wedge X_+) \cong \Ncal_*(X) \]
		where $\Ncal_*(X)$ denotes a certain group of bordism classes.
		\item A calculation of $\Ncal_*$.
	\end{itemize}
	Throughout this section, we will be using some results from differential topology that were never discussed in this Topology lecture course series in Bonn by Schwede (2020--2022). 
	
	\subsection{Generalized homology theories}
	
	We finally get around defining homology theories.
	
	\begin{definition}
		A \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright If one sets up everything correctly in the $\infty$-language, then a homology theory is essentially a spectrum...} \textbf{\tb{generalized homology theory}} consists of functors $E_k : \Top_* \to \Ab$ for $k \in \Z$ and natural homomorphisms (often called \textbf{\tb{connecting homomorphisms}}) \[ \partial : E_{k+1}(Cf) \to E_k(A) \]
		for all continuous based maps $f:A \to B$. This data must satisfy:
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item Additivity: For all families of based spaces $\{A_i \}_{i \in I}$ the canonical map
			\[ \bigoplus_{i \in I} E_k(A_i) \to E_k \left( \bigvee_{i \in I} A_i \right) \]
			is an isomorphism.
			\item Homotopy \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright A consequence is that homotopy equivalences are inverted by $E_k$. A different version is that weak homotopy equivalences are also inverted. In actual examples those homotopy invariant functors that do not satisfy this are probably not very useful.} invariance: If $f,g:A \to B$ are based homotopic, then $E_k(f) = E_k(g)$.
			\item Exactness: For all based continuous maps $f:A \to B$ the following is exact:
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\cdots \arrow[r] & E_{k+1}(Cf) \arrow[r, "\partial"] & E_k(A) \arrow[r, "E_k(f)"] & E_k(B) \arrow[r, "E_k(i)"] & E_k(Cf) \arrow[r, "\partial"] & \cdots 
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			where $i:B \to CA \cup_f B = Cf$ is the universal map of the pushout.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{definition}
	\noindent There are tons of variations (unbased spaces, pairs of spaces, ...) but for our purposes this is the most convenient.
	
	\begin{example}
		Let $E$ be a sequential spectrum. Then, the functors given by $\tb{E_k(A)} = \pi_k(E \wedge A)$ define \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Note how we denote both objects by $E$. This is not a coincidence: There is some sort of equivalence of categories (maybe imposing more conditions).} a generalized homology theory with respect to $\partial$ defined as
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				\pi_{k+1}(E \wedge Cf) \arrow[r, "\pi_k(E \wedge p)"] & \pi_{k+1}(E \wedge A \wedge S^1) & & \pi_k(E \wedge A) \arrow[ll, "{- \wedge S^1, \cong}", swap]
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		where we've defined $p$ in Section 3. In a sense almost all generalized homology theories come from spectra -- a key word is Brown's Representability Theorem.
	\end{example}

	\begin{remark} \label{remark: first consequences of generalized homology theory}
		Every generalized homology theory $\{E_k, \partial \}$ has the following properties:
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item For all $k \in \Z$ we have $E_k(*) = 0$.
			\item If $A$ is contractible \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright I was surprised at first because for unreduced cohomology theories this is reminiscent of the non-redundant dimension axiom.} to the basepoint, then $E_k(A) = 0$.
			\item There is a suspension isomorphism $E_k(A) \xrightarrow{\sim} E_{k+1}(A \wedge S^1)$.
			\item Let $(B,A)$ be a pair of spaces $A \subseteq B$ with the HEP. Then, there is a LES
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\cdots \arrow[r] & E_{k+1}(B/A) \arrow[r, "\delta"] & E_k(A) \arrow[r, "\incl_*"] & E_k(B) \arrow[r, "\proj_*"] & E_k(B/A) \arrow[r] & \cdots.
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center} 
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{remark}

	\begin{proof}
		In the lecture \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Wow, I actually cannot find a good English word for 'übersichtlicher'.} everything was inside the Remark but I think the statements are clearer if I separate the arguments from the statements.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item Additivity for $X = Y = *$ yields that
			\[ E_k(*) \oplus E_k(*) \to E_k(* \vee *) \cong E_k(*), \ (x,y) \mapsto x+y \]
			is an isomorphism.
			{\scriptsize \medskip \\So $(x,-x) \mapsto 0$ and since the isomorphism is injective, we get $(x,-x) = 0$ for every $x \in E_k(*)$. 
				\medskip \\Alternative proof: Let $A = B = *$ and $f:* \to *$. Then, $Cf = *$ since $* \wedge [0,1] = *$ because the basepoint gets identified. Therefore, the LES axiom yields an exact sequence
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						E_k(*) \arrow[r, "\sim"] & E_k(*) \arrow[r, "\sim"] & E_k(*)
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				and exactness forces $E_k(*) = 0$.
			}
			\item Follows from (i) and homotopy invariance.
			\item The unique map $t_A:A \to *$ has a long exact sequence
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					E_{k+1}(*) \arrow[r] & E_{k+1}(Ct_A) \arrow[r, "{\partial}"] & E_k(A) \arrow[r] & E_k(*) \arrow[r] & E_k(Ct_A)
					\\ 0 \arrow[u, equal] & & & 0 \arrow[u, equal]
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			which shows that $\partial$ is an isomorphism. Moreover, there is a homeomorphism 
			\[ Ct_A = CA \cup_A * \xrightarrow{p, \cong} A \wedge S^1 , \]
			so altogether we obtain the suspension isomorphism
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					E_k(A) \arrow[r, "{\partial^{-1}, \cong}"] & E_{k+1}(Ct_A) \arrow[rr, "{E_{k+1}(p), \cong}"] & & E_{k+1}(A \wedge S^1).
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			\item Since $A \to B$ is an $h$-cofibration, the map
			\[ 0 \cup \id_B : (A \wedge [0,1]) \cup_A B = C(\incl) \to B/A \]
			is a based homotopy equivalence, so homotopy invariance with the exactness axiom yields a LES
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\cdots \arrow[r] & E_{k+1}(B/A) \arrow[r, "\delta"] & E_k(A) \arrow[r, "\incl_*"] & E_k(B) \arrow[r, "\proj_*"] & E_k(B/A) \arrow[r] & \cdots
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			where $\tb{\delta}$ is defined by
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					E_{k+1}(B/A) \arrow[rr, "\delta"] & & E_k(A)
					\\ & E_{k+1}(C(\incl)) \arrow[ul, "{E_{k+1}(0 \cup \id_B), \cong}"] \arrow[ur, "\partial", swap]
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proof}

	\begin{remark}[Unreduced and relative theories]
		Let $X$ be a space. 
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item The \textbf{\tb{unreduced $E$-homology}} is given by $\tb{E_k^+(X)} = E_k(X_+)$. There is a homeomorphism 
			\[ \left(\coprod_{i \in I} X_i \right)_+ \cong \bigvee_{i \in I} (X_i)_+ \]
			e.g. by left adjointness of $(-)_+$. So additivity for the unreduced theory becomes an isomorphism
			\[ \bigoplus_{i \in I} E_k^+(X_i) \xrightarrow{\sim} E_k^+ \left(\coprod_{i \in I} X_i \right). \]
			\item For a pair of spaces $(X,Y)$ we write $CY \cup_Y X = ((Y \times [0,1]) \cup_Y X)/(Y \times \{0 \})$ for the \textbf{\tb{unreduced cone}}, based at the cone point $Y \times \{0 \}$. We define the \textbf{\tb{relative $E$-homology}} by
			\[ \tb{E_k(X,Y)} = E_k(CY \cup_Y X). \]
			Because the unreduced cone $CY \cup_Y X$ is homeomorphic \marginpar{\tiny \tr{Check.}}to the reduced cone of the inclusion $\iota:Y_+ \to X_+$, so we get a long exact sequence
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\cdots \arrow[r] & E_{k+1}(X, Y) \arrow[r, "\partial"] & E_k^+(Y) \arrow[r, "\incl_*"] & E_k^+(X) \arrow[r] & E_k(X,Y) \arrow[r] & \cdots
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			Note: Let $X$ be based by $x_0$, then $E_k(X, \{x_0 \}) \cong E_k(X)$.
		\end{enumerate}
		Many people would probably not decorate the notation of the unreduced homology theory but would rather decorate the reduced homology theory, e.g. with $\tilde{E}$ as is traditional with reduced singular homology $\tilde{H}$. However, Schwede deems the based theory more important, so that's why this is our undecorated notation.
	\end{remark}

	\begin{proposition}
		Let $\{E_k, \partial \}$ be a generalized homology theory. Let $\tel_i X_i$ be the mapping telescope \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Recall that $\tel_i X_i$ is the homotopy colimit of this sequence.} of a sequence of continuous maps
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				X_0 \arrow[r, "f_0"] & X_1 \arrow[r, "f_1"] & X_2 \arrow[r, "f_2"] & \cdots.
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		Then, the canonical maps $j_m:X_m \to \tel_i X_i$ induce an isomorphism
		\[ \colim_i E_k^+(X_i) \to E_k^+(\tel_i X_i). \]
	\end{proposition}

	\begin{proof}
		By construction the mapping telescope is part of a pushout:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				\coprod_{i \geq 0} (X_i \times \{0,1 \}) \arrow[d, hookrightarrow] \arrow[rrr, "{(x,0) \mapsto x, \ (x,1) \mapsto f_i(x)}"] & & & \coprod_{i \geq 0} X_i \arrow[d, "j"]
				\\ \coprod_{i \geq 0} (X_i \times [0,1]) \arrow[rrr] & & & \tel_{i \geq 0} X_i
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		The left map has the HEP, i.e. is a (Hurewicz) cofibration, because products with a single object and coproducts preserve cofibrations. Hence, so is its pushout $j$. Note \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{Does this use the HEP?}}
		\[ \coker{j} \cong \bigvee_{i \geq 0} ((X_i)_+ \wedge S^1). \]
		By \textbf{\ref{remark: first consequences of generalized homology theory}}(iv) we obtain a long exact sequence
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				E_{k+1} \left(\bigvee_{i \geq 0} ((X_i)_+ \wedge S^1) \right) \arrow[r, "\partial"] & E_k^+ \left(\coprod_{i \geq 0} X_i \right) \arrow[r] & E_k^+ \left(\tel_i X_i \right) \arrow[r] & E_k \left( \bigvee_{i \geq 0} ((X_i)_+ \wedge S^1) \right) 
				\\ \bigoplus_{i \geq 0} E_k^+(X_i) \arrow[u, "\wr"] \arrow[r, "\partial", swap] & \bigoplus_{i \geq 0} E_k^+(X_i) \arrow[u, "\wr", swap] 
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		Here, \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright The left-most isomorphism is the compatibility with coproducts and the suspension isomorphism.} $\partial(x) = x- (f_i)_*(x)$ for $x \in E_k(X_i)$. The map $\id - f_* : \bigoplus_{i \geq 0} E_k^+(X_i) \to \bigoplus_{i \geq 0} E_k^+(X_i)$ is injective, and its cokernel is
		\[ \colim \left( E_k^+(X_0) \xrightarrow{(f_0)_*} E_k^+(X_1) \xrightarrow{(f_1)_*} \cdots \right) = \coker(\partial) \xrightarrow{\sim} E_k^+(\tel{X_i}). \]
		{\scriptsize Here are some details for the last isomorphism. It is a consequence of the exactness using that $\partial$ is injective. Indeed, we compute
			\begin{align*}
				\coker{\partial} &= E_k^+ \left(\coprod_i X_i \right)/\im{\partial}
				\\ &= E_k^+ \left(\coprod_i X_i \right)/\ker \left( E_k^+ \left(\coprod_{i \geq 0} X_i \right) \to E_k^+(\tel_i X_i) \right)
				\\ &\cong \im \left( E_k^+ \left(\coprod_{i \geq 0} X_i \right) \to E_k^+(\tel_i X_i) \right)
				\\ &= \ker \left(E_k^+(\tel_i X_i) \to E_k \left( \bigvee_{i \geq 0} ((X_i)_+ \wedge S^1) \right) \right)
				\\ &= E_k^+(\tel{X_i})
			\end{align*}
		where the last step is because $\partial$ is injective, so 
		\[ \im \left(E_k^+(\tel_i X_i) \to E_k \left( \bigvee_{i \geq 0} ((X_i)_+ \wedge S^1) \right) \right) = \ker{\partial} = 0, \]
		i.e. $E_k^+(\tel_i X_i) \to E_k \left( \bigvee_{i \geq 0} ((X_i)_+ \wedge S^1 \right) = 0$.
		}
	\end{proof}

	\begin{corollary}
		If $X$ is a CW complex with skeleta $X_i$, then 
		\[ \colim_{i \geq 0} E^+_k(X_i) \to E^+_k(X) \]
		is an isomorphism.
	\end{corollary}

	\begin{proof}
		In this case \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright There is a proof in \url{https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/mapping+telescope}.} the map $\tel_i {X_i} \to \bigcup_i X_i = X$ is a homotopy equivalence.
	\end{proof}
	
	\noindent Let $E$ be an orthogonal ring spectrum. Then, the homology theory represented by $E$ supports the exterior products:
	\[ \tb{\times} : E_k(A) \times E_{\ell}(B) \to E_{k+\ell}(A \wedge B). \]
	This is $\pi_k(E \wedge A) \times \pi_{\ell}(E \wedge B) \to \pi_{k+\ell}(E \wedge A \wedge B)$. For representatives $f:S^{m+k} \to E_m \wedge A$ and $g:S^{n+\ell} \to E_n \wedge B$ in $E_k(A)$ and $E_{\ell}(B)$ we define $\tb{f \cdot g}$ as the composite
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			S^{m+k+n+\ell} \arrow[r, "f \wedge g"] & E_m \wedge A \wedge E_n \wedge B \arrow[rr, "{\shuffle, \cong}"] & & E_m \wedge E_n \wedge A \wedge B \arrow[r, "\mu_{m,n}"] & E_{m+n} \wedge A \wedge B.
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	We define $\tb{[f] \times [g]} = (-1)^{kn} \cdot [f \cdot g]$.
	
	\begin{proposition}
		For \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{How do we see: A ring spectrum represents a (co-)homology theory with a ring structure?}} an orthogonal ring spectrum $E$ these maps are associative, unital and graded-commutative. For $A = S^0$ these make $E_*(B)$ naturally into a graded $\pi_*(E)$-module, and $\partial$ is natural.
	\end{proposition}

	\noindent One reason we're discussing this is to give some context and not let \textbf{\ref{theorem: ring structure of stable homotopy groups}} be done in vain. Indeed, we will also see this in action later with bordisms. On the other hand, another rather logistic reason is simply that time is running out, so that we won't see other applications of this.

	\subsection{A borderline entry into bordism theory}
	This \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright I'm just trying to make a bad pun with this subsection title.} topic is a huge triumph relating stable homotopy theory with differential topology which was brought to us through a revolutionary paper by the French mathematician René Frédéric Thom where he e.g. proved things involving Thom-Pontryagin and so on. He was awarded a Fields Medal for this.
	
	\begin{definition}
		A \textbf{\tb{singular manifold}} of dimension $k$ over a space $X$ is a pair $(M,h)$ consisting of a smooth closed $k$-manifold $M$ and a continuous map $h:M \to X$.
		\medskip \\Two singular $k$-manifolds $(M,h)$ and $(M', h')$ over $X$ are \textbf{\tb{bordant}} if there is a \textbf{\tb{bordism}} $(B, H, \psi)$ consisting of 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item a compact smooth $(k+1)$-manifold $B$ with boundary,
			\item a continuous map $H:B \to X$,
			\item a diffeomorphism $\psi : M \amalg M' \to \partial B$ such that 
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					M \arrow[r, "\psi|_M"] \arrow[rd, "h", bend right, swap] & B \arrow[d, "H"] & M' \arrow[l, "\psi|_{M'}", swap] \arrow[dl, "h'", bend left]
					\\ & X
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{definition}
	\noindent Singular refers to $h$ only being continuous and it also probably comes from singular homology. Some people say \textbf{\tb{cobordant}} but Schwede doesn't know why. It is just longer.

		\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth, angle = 90]{Bordism}
		\caption{We're obligated to draw the classical bordism picture!}
	\end{figure}
	\noindent Bordism of singular $k$-manifolds over $X$ is an equivalence relation. Reflexivity and symmetry are quite immediate but transitivity is a tad subtle: We need to glue bordisms. The smooth structure at the gluing point is not clear. One uses this collar neighbourhood stuff (see \textbf{Lee, Introduction to Smooth Manifolds, 9.25}) from differential topology to do this. 
	\medskip \\Thus, we can let $\tb{\Ncal_k(X)}$ be the set of bordism classes of singular $k$-manifolds over $X$. This is indeed a set by all these embedding theorems. A monoid structure is given by disjoint union in $M$ with $\emptyset$ as the neutral element.
	\begin{remark}
		For all $x \in \Ncal_{k}(X)$ we have $2x = 0$.
		\begin{figure}[H]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth, angle = 90]{BordismF2}
			\caption{If we rotate the picture by $90$ degrees, then this is the picture for reflexivity.}
		\end{figure}
	\end{remark}

	\begin{proof}
		Let $x = [M,h]$. Consider the diagram \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{Doesn't this only 'show' $x = x$???}}
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				M \arrow[r, "{(-,0)}"] \arrow[dr, "h", bend right, swap] & M \times [0,1] = B \arrow[d, "h \circ \pr_1"] & M \arrow[l, "{(-,1)}", swap] \arrow[dl, "h", bend left]
				\\ & X
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		Here, $M \amalg M = \partial (M \times [0,1])$.
		{\scriptsize \medskip \\I'm really not convinced by the above attempt. Instead something like
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					M \amalg M \arrow[r] \arrow[dr, "{(h,h)}", bend right, swap] & M \times [0,1] \arrow[d, "{h \times [0,1]}"] & \emptyset \arrow[l] \arrow[dl, bend left]
					\\ & X
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
		should work. Schwede's diagram does show that bordism is a reflexive relation but I don't see the connection to $2x = 0$.
		}
	\end{proof}
	\noindent Thus, $\Ncal_k(X)$ is a group and in fact a $\F_2$-vector space. Moreover, $\Ncal_k$ is functorial in continuous maps $f:X \to Y$ by postcomposition. So we obtain functor $\Ncal : \Top \to \Ab$.
	
	\begin{proposition}
		Let $X,Y$ be spaces.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item Let $\phi, \phi':X \to Y$ be homotopic, then $\phi_* = \phi_*' : \Ncal_k(X) \to \Ncal_k(Y)$.
			\item For every weak homotopy equivalence $\phi:X \to Y$ the map $\phi_*:\Ncal_k(X) \to \Ncal_k(Y)$ is an isomorphism.
			\item For all spaces $\{X_i \}_{i \in I}$ the canonical map
			\[ \bigoplus_{i \in I} \Ncal_k(X_i) \to \Ncal_k \left( \coprod_{i \in I} X_i \right). \]
			is an isomorphism.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proposition}

	\begin{proof}
		Let's go.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item Let $H:X \times [0,1] \to Y$ be a homotopy from $\phi$ to $\phi'$ and let $(M,h)$ be a singular $k$-manifold over $X$. Then, $(M \times [0,1], H \circ (h \times [0,1]), \psi)$ where $\psi:M \amalg M \to M \times [0,1]$ which is the inclusion of the $M$-summands at both ends is a bordism from $(M, \phi \circ h)$ to $(M, \phi' \circ h)$.
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					M \arrow[r] \arrow[ddr, bend right] & M \times [0,1] \arrow[d, "{h \times [0,1]}"] & M \arrow[l] \arrow[ddl, bend left]
					\\ & X \times [0,1] \arrow[d, "H"]
					\\ & X
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			So 
			\[ \phi_*[M,h] = [M, \phi h] = [M, \phi'h] = \phi_*'[M,h]. \]
			\item Let $\phi:X \to Y$ be a weak equivalence. We show surjectivity and injectivity separately.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Surjectivity: Let $(M, g)$ be a singular $k$-manifold over $Y$. A strong result from differential topology says that smooth manifolds can be triangulated, and so these admit CW structures. Since $\phi$ is a weak homotopy equivalence, the lifting problem
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						\emptyset \arrow[r] \arrow[d, rightarrowtail] & X \arrow[d, "{\phi, \approx}"]
						\\ M \arrow[ur, "h", dashed] \arrow[r, "g", swap] & Y
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				can be solved such that the lower triangle commutes up to homotopy (\textbf{Algebraic Topology 1, \#10.2}). Then,
				\begin{align*}
					\phi_*[M,h] &= [M, \phi h]
					\\ &= (\phi h)_* [M, \id_M]
					\\ &= g_* [M, \id_M]
					\\ &= [M, g].
				\end{align*}
				using (i).
				\item Injectivity: Let $(M,h)$ be a singular $k$-manifold over $X$ such that 
				\[ [M, \phi h] = \phi_*[M,h] = 0 \]
				in $\Ncal_k(Y)$. Then, there is a nullbordism $(B, H:B \to Y, \psi)$ of $\phi h:M \to Y$.
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						M \arrow[r, "\psi"] \arrow[dr, "\phi h", bend right, swap] & B \arrow[d, "H"] & \emptyset \arrow[l] \arrow[dl, bend left]
						\\ & Y
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center} The triangulation result from differential topology can even endow $B$ with a triangulation such that $\partial B$ is a subcomplex. So $\partial B$ is CW subcomplex of $B$. Thus, we get 
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tikzcd}
						\partial B \overset{\psi}{\cong} M \arrow[r, "h"] \arrow[d, hookrightarrow] & X \arrow[d, "{\phi, \approx}"]
						\\ B \arrow[ur, dashed, "K"] \arrow[r, "H", swap] & Y
					\end{tikzcd}
				\end{center}
				where the lower triangle is up to homotopy again (\textbf{Algebraic Topology 1, \#10.2}). So $(B, K, \psi)$ is a nullbordism for $(M,h)$.
			\end{itemize}
			\item All manifolds and bordisms that we're considering are compact, so there are finitely many path components. Thus, all continuous maps $h:M \to \coprod_{i \in I} X_i$ take values in $\coprod_{i \in J} X_i$ for some finite subset $J \subseteq I$, and similarly for bordisms. For $j \in J$ we take $M_j = h^{-1}(X_j) \subseteq M$. Then, 
			\[ [M,h] = \sum_{j \in J} {[M_j, h|_{M_j} ]}. \]
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proof}

		which we can WLOG assume to be smooth. Let $t \in (0,1)$ be a regular value of $r$ via Sard's Theorem. By the Regular Value Theorem $r^{-1}(t)$ is a smooth  closed regularly embedded submanifold of $M$ of dimension $k-1$. Moreover, $h(r^{-1}(t)) \subseteq A \cap B$. So we may set

The main point is that the smooth structure is not at all clear, especially at $\infty$ and moreover the one-point compactification of topological manifolds need not even be a topological manifold again. The pressing matter is: We defined $S^n = \R^n_{\infty}$, so which smooth structure do we choose? There are exotic smooth structures on $S^n$ after all and a priori $S^n$ doesn't just obtain a natural smooth structure from $\R^n$ via this compactification.

	\subsection{Thom-Pontryagin construction}
	We wish to construct a map
	\[ \tb{\Theta} : \NN_k(X) \to \tb{\MO_k(X_+)} = \pi_k(\MO \wedge X_+). \]
	To fix our notation let us recall some stuff about $\MO$ first. 
	\medskip \\We will work with the sequential \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright This doesn't extend to an orthogonal spectrum.} spectrum given by $\MO_n = \Th(\Gr_n(\R^{\infty}))$. Every linear monomorphism $\alpha : V \injArrow W$ induces a based map of 
	\[ \alpha_* : \Th(\Gr_n(V)) \to \Th(\Gr_n(W)), \ [v,L] \mapsto [\alpha(v), \alpha(L)] \]
	where we take a monomorphism so that the dimension during the process $L \mapsto \alpha(L)$ doesn't drop. The structure maps are given by
	\begin{align*}
		S^1 \wedge \Th(\Gr_n(\R^{\infty})) &\to \Th(\Gr_{1+n}(\R^{\infty})),
		\\ x \wedge [v,L] &\mapsto [(x,v), \R \oplus L].
	\end{align*} 
	Let $M$ be a compact smooth $k$-manifold, possibly with boundary. The \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright The notation is ad hoc. Note that $M/\emptyset = M_+$.} \textbf{\tb{fundamental class}} $\tb{\langle M \rangle} \in \MO_k(M/\partial M)$ is defined as follows: We choose a smooth embedding $i:M \injArrow \R^{n+k}$. The \textbf{\tb{normal bundle $\nu$}} has as total space
	\[ \nu = \{(v,m) \in \R^{n+k} \times M : v \perp (\DD i)(T_m M) \}. \]
	We can assume that the \textbf{\tb{exponential map}}
	\[ D(\nu) = \{(v,m) \in \R^{n+k} \times M : v \perp (\DD i)(T_m M), \ |v| \leq 1 \} \to \R^{n+k}, \ (v,m) \mapsto v + i(m) \]
	is am embedding. 
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth, angle = 90]{Tube}
		\caption{This looks like a tubular neighbourhood.}
	\end{figure}
	\noindent The \textbf{\tb{collapse map}} is the continuous map
	\begin{align*}
		\Th(\Gr_n(\R^{n+k})) \wedge M/\partial M &\leftarrow S^{n+k} = \R^{n+k} \cup \{\infty \}: \tb{c(i)}, 
		\\ * &\mapsfrom S^{n+k} \setminus \mathring{D}(\nu)
		\\ \left(\frac{v}{1-|v|}, (\DD i)(T_m M)^{\perp} \right) \wedge m &\mapsfrom v + i(m)
	\end{align*} 
	for $v \in \R^{n+k}, |v| < 1, m \in M$. Then, $\langle M \rangle$ is represented by the composite
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			S^{n+k} \arrow[r, "c(i)"] & \Th(\Gr_n(\R^{n+k})) \wedge M/\partial M \arrow[r, "\kappa^{n+k}_*"] & \Th(\Gr_n(\R^{\infty})) \wedge M/\partial M = \MO_n \wedge M/\partial M
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	in $\MO_k(M/\partial M)$ where
	\[ \tb{\kappa^{n+k}} : \R^{n+k} \to \R^{\infty}, (x_1, \cdots, x_{n+k}) \mapsto (x_1, \cdots, x_{n+k}, 0,0, \cdots). \]
	
	\begin{proposition}
		The class $\langle M \rangle \in \MO_K(M/\partial M)$ is independent of the choice of the embedding $i$.
	\end{proposition}

	\begin{proof}[Proof sketch.]
		If we replace $i:M \injArrow \R^{n+k}$ by $\alpha \circ i:M \injArrow \R^{1+n+k}$ with
		\[ \alpha : \R^{n+k} \to \R^{1+n+k}, \ (x_1, \cdots, x_{n+k}) \mapsto (0, x_1, \cdots, x_{n+k}), \]
		then $c(\alpha \circ i)$ is homotopic to the composite 
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				S^{1+n+k} \arrow[r, "S^1 \wedge c(i)"] & S^1 \wedge \Th(\Gr_n(\R^{n+k})) \wedge M/\partial M \arrow[r, "S^1 \wedge \kappa^{n+k}_*"] & S^1 \wedge \Th(\Gr_n(\R^{\infty})) \wedge M/ \partial M \arrow[d, equal] 
				\\ & & S^1 \wedge \MO_n \wedge M/\partial M \arrow[d, "\sigma_n"] 
				\\ & & \MO_{1+n} \wedge M/\partial M.
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		Now let $i:M \injArrow \R^{n+k}$ and $j:M \injArrow \R^{\ol{n} + k}$ be two smooth wide embeddings. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright \tr{What is a wide embedding?}} WLOG $n = \ol{n}$. Consider
		\begin{align*}
			M \times [0,1] &\to \R^{n+k} \oplus \R^{n+k}
			\\ (m,t) &\mapsto (t i(m), (1-t)i(m))
		\end{align*}
		which gives a homotopy $c(\emb_1 \circ i) \simeq c(\emb_2 \circ i)$. Moreover, there is
		\begin{align*}
			M \times [0,1] &\to \R^{n+k} \oplus \R^{n+k}
			\\ (m,t) &\mapsto (t i(m), (1-t) j(m)).
		\end{align*}
		Together, these gives a homotopy $c(\emb_2 \circ i) \simeq c(\emb_2 \circ j)$.
	\end{proof}

	\begin{example}
		Consider $\langle S^1 \rangle \in \MO_1(S_+^1)$ along with $q:S_+^1 \to S^1, \ + \mapsto \infty$ and the induced map $q_* : \MO_1(S_+^1) \to \MO_1(S^1)$. Then,
		\[ q_* \langle S^1 \rangle = 1 \wedge S^1. \]
	\end{example}

	\begin{proposition}
		Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth closed $k$-manifolds.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item In $\MO_k(M/\partial M \wedge N/\partial N) \cong \MO_k \left( \frac{M \amalg N}{\partial (M \amalg N)} \right)$ we have 
			\[ \langle M \cup N \rangle = i_*^1 \langle M \rangle + i_*^2 \langle N \rangle \]
			where $i^1 : M/\partial M \to M/\partial M \vee N/\partial N$ and $i^2 : N/\partial N \to M/\partial M \vee N/ \partial N$.
			\item For $\delta : \MO_k(M/\partial M) \to \MO_{k-1}(\partial M)$ we have
			\[ \delta \langle M \rangle = \langle \partial M \rangle \]
			is $\MO_{k-1}(\partial M_+)$. 
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proposition}

	\begin{proof}
		Part (ii) will be very very sketchy.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item Let $N/\partial N \xleftarrow{p_2} \frac{M \amalg N}{\partial (M \amalg N)} \xrightarrow{p_1}$ be the projections. Let $i:M \amalg N \injArrow \R^{n+k}$ be a wide smooth embedding. Then, the collapse map of $i|_M : M \to \R^{n+k}$ equals the composite
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					S^{n+k} \arrow[r, "c(i)"] & \Th(\Gr_n(\R^{n+k})) \wedge \frac{M \amalg N}{\partial (M \amalg N)} \arrow[r, "\id \wedge p^1"] & \Th(\Gr_n(\R^{n+k})) \wedge M/\partial M.
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			So $p_*^1 \langle M \amalg N \rangle = \langle M \rangle$ in $\MO_k(M/\partial M)$. The map
			\[ (p_*^1, p_*^2) : \MO_k \left( \frac{M \amalg N}{\partial(M \amalg N)} \right) \to \MO_k(M/\partial M) \times \MO_k(N/\partial N) \]
			is an isomorphism! Under this map we have
			\[ p_*^1 \langle M \amalg N \rangle = \langle M \rangle = p_*^1(i_*^1 \langle M \rangle + i_*^2 \langle N \rangle). \]
			\item Choose a collar $c: \partial M \times [0,1] \injArrow M$. First embed $i:\partial M \injArrow \R^{n+k-1}$. Then, extend 
			\[ \partial M \times \id : \partial M \times [0,1] \to \R^{n+k-1} \times [0,1] \injArrow \R^{n+k} \]
			to an embedding of $M$ (via differential topology). We can then somehow control the collapse map along the first part of the following picture.

	\noindent Part (ii) is the main ingredient for the Thom-Pontryagin construction to make sense for bordisms. The lecture culminates in the following important definition.
	
	\begin{definition}
		We define 
		\[ \tb{\Theta} : \NN_k(X) \to \MO_k(X), \ [M,h] \mapsto h_* \langle M \rangle \]

	\noindent There is an analogy: The manifold $M$ has a $\bmod \ 2$-fundamental class $[M] \in H_k(M, \partial M, \F_2)$ which satisfies $\partial [M] = [\partial M]$. There is a unique non-trivial morphism $\vartheta : \MO \to H \F_2$ in $\SH$ which satisfies \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright We didn't have time to cover the last isomorphism in the lecture.}
	\[ \vartheta_* \langle M \rangle = [M] \in (H \F_2)_k(M/\partial M) \cong H_k(M, \partial M; \F_2). \]
	
	\begin{proposition}
		The class $\Theta [M,h]$ only depends on the bordism class of $(M,h)$.
	\end{proposition}

	\begin{proof}
		Let $(M^k,h)$ be a singular $k$-manifold \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright The exponents denote the dimension.} over $X$ and let $(B^{k+1}, H, \psi: M \xrightarrow{\sim} \partial B)$ be a null-bordism. Write $\iota : \partial B \injArrow B$ for the inclusion. Then, $h = H \circ \iota \circ \psi$, so we obtain
		\[ h_* \langle M \rangle = (H \circ \iota \circ \psi)_* \langle M \rangle = H_*(\iota_* \langle \partial B \rangle) = H_*(\iota_*(\delta \langle B \rangle)) = 0 \]
		which uses that $\iota_*$ and $\delta$ are adjacent in a LES. 
		\medskip \\Because $\langle M \rangle$ is also additive for disjoint unions, we deduce $h_* \langle M \rangle = g_* \langle N \rangle$ if $(M,h)$ is bordant to $\langle N, g \rangle$.
	\end{proof}

	\begin{theorem}
		Let $X$ be a space.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item The Thom-Pontryagin map $\Theta : \NN_k(X) \to \MO_k(X)$ is additive.
			\item The Thom-Pontryagin assemble into a natural transformation of homology theories.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{theorem}

	\begin{proof}
		We remain sketchy.
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			\item Straightforward.
			\item Let $f:X \to Y$ be a continuous map. Consider
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\tilde{\NN}_{k+1}(Cf) \arrow[r, "p_*"] \arrow[rr, "\delta", bend left] \arrow[d, "\Theta", swap] & \tilde{N}_{k+1}(X_+ \wedge S^1) \arrow[d, "\Theta"] & \NN_k(X) \arrow[l, "{- \wedge d, \cong}", swap] \arrow[d, "\Theta"]
					\\ \MO_{k+1}(Cf) \arrow[rr, bend right, "\delta", swap] \arrow[r, "p_*", swap] & \MO_{k+1}(X_+ \wedge S^1) & \MO_k(X) \arrow[l, "{- \wedge S^1, \cong}"] 
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{center}
			The left square commutes by naturality. We check that the right square commutes. Let $x \in \tilde{\NN}_k(X_+)$. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright There is an exterior product in homology since it comes from a ring spectrum.}
			\[ \Theta(x \wedge d) = \Theta(x) \times \Theta(d) = \Theta(x) \times (1 \wedge S^1) = \Theta(x) \wedge S^1. \]
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proof}

	\begin{theorem}[Thom]
		For every space $X$ the map $\Theta : \NN_k(X) \to \MO_k(X_+)$ is an isomorphism.
	\end{theorem}

	\begin{proof}
		We start with the special case $X = *$. In this case we will equivalently write 
		\[ \Theta : \NN_k \to \pi_k(\MO). \]
		We discuss surjectivity. Let $f:S^{n+k} \to \MO_n = \Th(\Gr_n(\R^{\infty}))$ be a continuous based map that represents a class in $\pi_k(\MO)$. Because $S^{n+k}$ is compact, $f$ has image in $\Th(\Gr_n(V))$ for some finite-dimensional linear subspace $V \subseteq \R^{\infty}$. We get
		\[ \Th(\Gr_n(V)) = \gamma_n(\Gr_n(V)) \cup \{\infty \} \]
		where $\gamma_n(\Gr_n(V))$ is a smooth manifold again as the total space over a smooth manifold. The zero section
		\[ s : \Gr_n(V) \to \Th(\Gr_n(V)), \ L \mapsto (0, L) \]
		is smooth. The map $f$ is based homotopic to a map $g:S^{n+k} \to \Th(\Gr_n(V))$ that is transverse to the zero section. Thus, $g^{-1}(s(\Gr_n(V)))$ is a smooth submanifold of $\R^{n+k}$ of codimension \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright The zero section does not hit $\infty$, so the preimage also won't hit $\infty \in S^{n+k}$.} $n$. So $M = g^{-1}(s(\Gr_n(V)))$ is a smooth closed $k$-manifold inside $\R^{n+k}$. Then,
		\[ \Theta [M] = [g] = [f]. \]
		We use:
		\begin{quote}
			\textbf{Claim.} Every natural transformation of homology theories that is an isomorphism of coefficients is an isomorphism on all based CW complexes.
			
			\begin{proof}
				Use the suspension isomorphism and induction over the CW structure.
			\end{proof}
		\end{quote}
		
		\noindent Thus, $\Theta$ is an isomorphism for all CW complexes. Because both sides are invariant under weak equivalences, this is an isomorphism in general after a CW-approximation.
		
	\end{proof}

	\begin{example}
		Recall that $0$-dimensional smooth closed manifolds are finite sets of points. The bordism classes correspond to the parity of cardinalities, so $\NN_0 \cong \F_2$. Recall also that \textbf{\#10.2} yields
		\[ \NN_0(X) \cong H_0(X;\F_2) = \F_2[\pi_0(X)]. \]
	\end{example}
		\begin{theorem}[Thom]
			The map $\NN_k(X) \to H_k(X, \F_2)$ is surjective.
		\end{theorem}
		\noindent This was originally a question of Steenrod who asked whether every homology class can be represented by a smooth manifold. It is not true for integral homology but for $\F_2$-homology we see the above.
		\begin{proposition}
			For even-dimensional manifolds the Euler characteristic $\bmod \ 2$ is a bordism invariant.
		\end{proposition}
	
		\begin{proof}
			Some Poincaré duality argument. See \textbf{\#10.3} or the notes.
		\end{proof}
	
		\noindent For even $k$ we get $[\R P^k] \neq 0$ in $\NN_k$. Is $[\R P^4] = [\R P^2 \times \R P^2]$ in $\NN_k$?
	
	\begin{theorem}[Thom] 
		The bordism ring $\NN_*$ is a polynomial algebra over $\F_2$ with a generator for all dimensions $i \geq 2$ which is not of the form $2^k - 1$. In other words,
		\[ \NN_* = \F_2[x_2, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_8, \cdots]. \]
		Moreover, for even $k$ one can take $x_k = [\R P^k]$. \textbf{\tb{Dold manifolds}} can be taken as odd-dimensional generators.
	\end{theorem}

	\noindent There is an independent homotopy-theoretic argument by doing computations on cohomology of Thom spaces via cohomology of Grassmannians along with the action of the Steenrod algebra and so on and so on.
	\medskip \\However, we are more into geometric ideas. Now, you may ask: We have been doing homotopy theory the enire semester. Why now of all times would we suddenly want to insist on differential topology? Well, one reason is that Schwede's colleagues would complain that we did nothing explicit.
	\subsection{Stiefel-Whitney theory}
	Let $\xi:E \to X$ be a real vector bundle over a paracompact space $X$. Its \textbf{\tb{Stiefel-Whitney classses}} are elements $\tb{w_i(\xi)} \in H^i(X;\F_2)$ for $i \geq 0$ characterized by the following properties:
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item Compatibility with pullbacks: $f^*(w_i(\xi)) = w_i(f^* \xi))$ for continuous $f:Y \to X$. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright So this is determined by the tautological bundle.}
		\item Effect of direct sum: $w_i(\xi \oplus \eta) = \sum_{a+b = i} w_a(\xi) \smile w_b(\eta)$.
		\item Special classes: $w_0(\xi) = 1, \ w_1(\gamma_1 \downarrow \R P^{\infty}) \neq 0 \in H^1(\R P^{\infty}, \F_2)$.
		\item Condition about dimensions: $w_i(\xi) = 0$ for $i > \rank(\xi)$. \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright This follows from the other properties.}
	\end{enumerate}

	\begin{construction}
		Let $r_1, \cdots, r_k \geq 0$ be natural numbers such that $r_1 + 2 r_2 + \cdots + kr_k = k$. Let $M$ be a smooth closed $k$-manifold. We write $\tb{w_i(M)} = w_i(\tau_M) \in H^i(M; \F_2)$ for the $i$-th Stiefel-Whitney class of the tangent bundle $TM$ of $M$. The \textbf{\tb{Stiefel-Whitney number}} associated to $(r_1, \cdots, r_k)$ is
		\[ \underbrace{(w_1(M)^{r_1} \smile w_2(M)^{r_2} \smile \cdots \smile w_k(M)^{r_k})}_{\in H^k(M;\F_2)} \frown [M] \in \{0,1 \}. \]
		If $M$ is connected, then this number is $1$ if and only if $w_1(M)^{r_1} \smile \cdots \smile w_k(M)^k \neq 0$.
	\end{construction}

	\noindent We're doing it this way because in the more general story of Chern classes this is the correct approach where we get integers.
	
	\begin{proposition} \label{prop: Stiefel Whintey numbers are bordism invariants}
		The Stiefel-Whitney numbers \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Thom also proved the converse!} of any sequence of natural numbers are bordism invariants of smooth closed $k$-manifolds.
	\end{proposition}

	\begin{proof}
		First, homology and cohomology takes disjoint unions to products, so Stiefel-Whitney numbers are additive. So it suffices to show that all Stiefel-Whitney numbers vanish on nullbordant manifolds. Let $B$ be a compact smooth $(k+1)$-manifold. The tangent bundle of $B$ and $\partial B$ are related by \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright The $\ul{\R}$ is sort of the choice of a collar direction.}
		\[ \tau_B|_{\partial B} \cong \tau_{\partial B} \oplus \ul{\R}. \]
		Hence,
		\[ w_i(\tau_B|_{\partial B}) = w_i(\tau_{\partial B} \oplus \ul{\R}) = w_i(\tau_{\partial B}). \]
		Let $\iota : \partial B \to B$ be the inclusion. We get
		\begin{align*}
			(w_1(\partial B)^{r_1} \smile \cdots \smile w_k(\partial B)^{r_k}) \frown [\partial B] &= \iota^*(w_1(B)^{r_1} \smile \cdots \smile w_k(B)^{r_k}) \frown [\partial B]
			\\ &= (w_1(B)^{r_1} \smile \cdots \smile w_k(B)^{r_n}) \frown \iota_*[\partial B]
			\\ &= (w_1(B)^{r_1} \smile \cdots \smile w_k(B)^{r_k}) \frown \iota_*(\partial [B])
			\\ &= 0.
		\end{align*}
	\end{proof}

	\begin{example}
		Consider $(0, \cdots, 0, 1)$. Then, 
		\[ w_k(M) \frown [M] \equiv \chi(M) \pmod 2. \]
		In fact, \textbf{\#10.3} is a special case of this.
	\end{example}

	\begin{example}[Stiefel-Whitney classes of projective space]
		Recall $H^{\bullet}(\R P^k;\F_2) = \F_2[a]/(a^{k+1})$. In fact, $a = w_1(\gamma_1) \in H^1(\R P^k; \F_2)$ by the naturality of the inclusion and (iii) from Stiefel-Whitney classes.
		\begin{quote}
			\textbf{Fact.} There \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright This is the relation between the two natural bundles over $\R P^k$.} is an isomorphism $\tau_{\R P^k} \oplus \ul{\R} = \bigoplus_{i=1}^{k+1} \gamma_1$.
			
			\begin{proof}
				'Only' two pages in Milnor-Stasheff.

		\end{quote}
	
		\noindent The \textbf{\tb{total Stiefel Whitney class}} is 
		\[ \tb{w_{\tot}(\xi)} = w_0(\xi) + w_1(\xi) + w_2(\xi) + \cdots \]
		and we may write out $w_{\tot}(\xi \oplus \eta) = w_{\tot}(\xi) \smile w_{\tot}(\eta)$. So we compute
		\[ w_{\tot}(\tau_{\R P^k}) = w_{\tot}(\tau_{\R P^k} \oplus \ul{\R}) = w_{\tot}(\gamma_1^{\oplus (k+1)}) = w_{\tot}(\gamma_1)^{(k+1)} = (1+a)^{k+1} \]
		Comparing coefficients we obtain
		\[ w_i(\tau_{\R P^k}) = \binom{k+1}{i} a^i \in H^i(\R P^k;\F_2). \]
		The first examples are \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright We have $\R P^3 = \operatorname{SO}(3)$ or so, so it has a trivial tangent bundle as a Lie group.}
		\begin{align*}
			w_{\tot}(\R P^1) &= 1,
			\\ w_{\tot}(\R P^2) &= 1 + a + a^2,
			\\ w_{\tot}(\R P^3) &= 1,
			\\ w_{\tot}(\R P^4) &= 1 + a + a^4.
		\end{align*}
		Let's compute the Stiefel-Whitney numbers.
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{l | l  l  l  l  l}
				& $(4,0,0,0)$ & $(2,1,0,0)$ & $(0,2,0,0)$ & $(1,0,1,0)$ & $(0,0,0,1)$ 
				\\ \hline
				$\R P^4$ & $1$ & $0$ & $0$ & $0$ & $1$
				\\ $\R P^2 \times \R P^2$ & $0$
				\\ \hline 
				& $w_1^4$ & $w_1^2 w_2$ & $w_2^2$ & $w_1 w_3$ & $w_4$
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
		We are using $w_2(\R P^4) = w_3(\R P^4) = 0$ and $w_1(\R P^4)^4 = w_4(\R P^4) = a^4$. 
	\end{example}

	\begin{example}
		We discuss $\R P^2 \times \R P^2$. Recall \marginpar{\tiny \raggedright Künneth Theorem.}
		\[ H^{\bullet}(\R P^2 \times \R P^2;\F_2) = \F_2[b,c]/(b^3, c^3) \]
		where $b = \pr_1^*(a)$ and $c = \pr_2^*(a)$ for $\pr_1, \pr_2 : \R P^2 \times \R P^2 \to \R P^2$. Moreover, we have $\tau_{\R P^2 \times \R P^2} \cong \tau_{\R P^2} \times \tau_{\R P^2}$. We thus obtain
		\[ w_{\tot}(\tau_{\R P^2 \times \R P^2}) = \pr_1^*(w_{\tot}(\R P^2)) \smile \pr_2^*(w_{\tot}(\R P^2)) = (1+b+b^2) \smile (1+c+c^2). \]
		Thus,
		\begin{align*}
			w_1(\R P^2 \times \R P^2) &= b + c,
			\\ w_2(\R P^2 \times \R P^2) &= b^2 + bc + c^2,
			\\ w_3(\R P^2 \times \R P^2) &= b^2 c + bc^2,
			\\ w_4(\R P^2 \times \R P^2) &= b^2 c^2.
		\end{align*}
		Thus, $w_1^4 = (b+c)^4 = 0$, and so on.
	\end{example}

	\noindent Our table of Stiefel-Whitney numbers now distinguish the bordism classes (\textbf{\ref{prop: Stiefel Whintey numbers are bordism invariants}}): 
	\[ [\R P^4] \neq [\R P^2 \times \R P^2] \in \NN_4. \]
	The table is not complete but already enough to give this deduction. Filling in the table is left as an exercise to the audience.
